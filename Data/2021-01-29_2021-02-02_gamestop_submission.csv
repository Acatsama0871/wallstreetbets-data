34,l7m51w,A message to the front page.,233,"You guys this message needs to get to the front page.

This is an ELI5

If you bought GameStop shares this week. Hold them. This is going to be a bumpy ride, you might see it dip below $100. DO. NOT. SELL. 

This stock is trading on the basis that these rich assholes sold more borrowed shares than actual exist. 

They HAVE to buy these back at some point. The more people who buy and hold shares, the more the market gets starved. 

When the market is starved  the supply will be less than the demand, and at that point we get to name our price. The potential is mathematically infinite while the companies have their loaned shares out. Which they do. 

But they’re going to make it tonight and try to bring the price down. This is no longer about the money. This is occupy Wall Street v2, this is a movement, and idea. And when you have a good idea you have to fucking stay with it. 

It’s not to late to get it for anyone asking. I bought today, I bight at $340 yesterday. 

The more people who hold. The more people who refuse to let them have their way. The more people who’ve finally had enough. This is protest. This is the end game.

64,l7mpym,Vlad Tenev &amp; Baiju are ex-High Frequency Trader (Co-Founders of Robinhood). An Expose.,4,"Vlad Tenev (CEO) &amp; Baiju Bhatt (Co-founder) are ex-High Frequency Traders. They started out their careers as a HFT to engage in market manipulation &amp; front running for profit. Only then did they realize that selling order flow to allow other HFTs to front-run and manipulate the markets was a much more profitable &amp; scalable business than being an HFT themselves. Thus Robinhood was born. 

**Source:** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir\_Tenev**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Tenev)

""In 2010, Tenev and Bhatt started a [high-frequency trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading) company called Celeris. By January 2011 they abandoned it to create Chronos Research, which sold low-latency software to other trading firms and banks.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Tenev#cite_note-techcrunch.com-6)

In 2013, Tenev and Bhatt co-founded the trading platform Robinhood.""

As ex-HFTs, they 100% knew what they were doing today by halting buy orders of Gamestop. 

I don't doubt that Robinhood's clearing firm Apex Corporation was under massive stress / risk of short sellers not being able to cover their positions with $GME's price above $400 and only trending upwards. Hell, Interactive Brokers Chairman openly said that on CNBC [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision). 

However by allowing his customers to not only not be able to buy $GME, but also allow them to sell $GME and actively close positions of users who artificially were forced into a margin call by MMs trading the stock down on low volume is disgusting. 

They KNEW that by allowing users to not to be able to buy, but to be able sell, MMs would be able to take advantage of the low volume tank the price and some of his users would either panic sell or be liquidated by margin calls. The stress on clearance houses would be eased and all order in the world HFTs would be restored. 

If Vlad &amp; Baiju were actually looking out for their users, and not their actual customers the HFTs, they would have restricted all purchases &amp; sales of Gamestop stock. Clearly, they did not do that and it shows who Robinhood actually serves -- the HFTs they once aspired to be. 

As Munger, says ""**Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome**.""

From the inception this guy never had your best interests at heart and I assume that's what Chamath was not so subtly alluding to [here](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526). 

Lastly, I was a Robinhood customer for 3 years until I started trading options back in March when I joined the sub (best thing that's ever happened to me). It became very clear to me after a few months how openly HFTs were front running our order flow on RH, since my option orders would only fill once the bid / ask spread comfortably passed my limit order or limit sell. 

I then switched to Fidelity, TD, and now Schawb. Please do yourself a favor and once you sell your $GME positions get yourself a real broker &amp; never do business with someone so clearly acting against your interests as an end customer. Fidelity, eTrade, Schawb, and SoFi are all great options as brokers. 

**TLDR --** 

1. **Vlad Tenev &amp; Baiju Bhatt are ex-HFT scum.** 
2. **Robinhood was founded on the idea that selling order flow to HFTs is a much better &amp; more scalable business than being a HFT yourself.** 
3. **RH (Vlad &amp; Baiju) knew stopping the ability for their users to purchase shares would artificially tank the price.** 
4. **If Vlad or Baiju had any self respect, believed in their fiduciary duty to his users, and didn't have the HFTs paying his bills they would have halted all purchases &amp; sales of GME shares.** 
5. **Once the squeeze is over never use Robinhood again.**
6. **I like the stock 🚀🌕🚀🌗🚀🌑**

77,l7my7b,Snowball Effect causing shorters to back out of positions across Europe,64,"This is one of many news the last couple of days on how hedge funds are repositioning after the GameStop drama (Swedish financial paper).

[Whale Rock decrease short position](https://www.di.se/live/storblankare-har-minskat-positionen-rejalt-i-fingerprint/)

The news are reporting, media profiles and politicians are jumping in. This has becoming much, much larger than Fuck You Melvin and GameStop.

I’ve been in banking for almost 20 years and this is changing how “we” talk (I’m actually retired). 

With the added transparency and speed from tech retail investors can compete with professionals. You can beat them at their own game.

They aren’t idiots, never think that these people are idiots. They are some of the most clever individuals around so they will adapt. 

Maybe shorting will be regulated or they will “regulate” themselves like we’re seeing now, closing many open positions.

So even of GameStop goes tits up (it won’t, it’s a 🚀 to the 🌙) this has changed a lot of things already. 

Well done. Keep your head high and dick swinging.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7my7b/snowball_effect_causing_shorters_to_back_out_of/,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52
