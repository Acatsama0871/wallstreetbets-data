8,l669vc,What is GME and what's up with all the news around it?,10,"# Welcome! This is for all the people who just joined this group. I'm sure you all heard it in the news and you're curious about what is happening.

The following is copied from one of the Discord servers I'm in:   


&gt;  
**GME or GameStop has been making the headlines lately with Jim Cramer calling it a short buster  move. What is the cause of the rapid gain in price** in a company that seems all but doomed to failure with store closures left and right and heavy laden with debt? Often times such things don‚Äôt come to light until after the fact, but here are some **possible factors:**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**1) FOMO** \- Reddit has been abuzz with this ticker for quite some time now. Let‚Äôs just say there‚Äôs lots of members and lots of money on there. This initial move catches the eyes of folks such as myself and we start piling in on the trade.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;2) **Change of board members** \- Cohen of CHWY fame is now on board and owns a 13% stake in GME and a success story of an internet retail company vs a field dominated by AMZN   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**3) Increased holiday sales** \- GameStop reported a nice surprise in the last earnings due to increased sales from the new console releases. As it happens every time a new generation of consoles comes out, GME makes a very strong spike upward.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**4) Infinity Squeeze** \- all the above factors have increased interest in GME. And the final ingredient is what is called the infinity squeeze. With this we have a short squeeze where short sellers of a stock are forced to buy back a stock at higher prices as the prices soar. This is a positive feedback loop and is made possible when a stock is excessively shorted. GME had a 140% short interest. Why is it over 100%? That is because the float of the stock is less than the total shares (not all share available to be traded).   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2008, VW in what is now known as the mother of all squeezes went to $1000. Hence the outlandish GME PTs you see floating around. However, the situation with GM is similar but different. The float is not nearly as small as VW back then.   You can read more about infinity squeeze from the VW 2008 infinity squeeze example - **highly recommended educational read as it shows why the ‚Äúbest shorts‚Äù are sometimes the most dangerous:**  [https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/)

23,l66j86,HOW TO KEEP WSB ALIVE - AND FIND THE NEXT GME,3,"# THE NEXT GME???

Settle down, autists, we're going to get there. First off let's do the DD (and since this is at least partly directed at WSB infants, I'll explain: that means Due Diligence, i.e. the facts). I'm going to link and explain a LOT of posts; if you've already seen them, or you're illiterate, feel free to just read the **BIG APE TEXT** and move along. Still, since we're four sentences in, that filters out the true retards which means I can TL;DR the TL;DR - enough hype can make *any* stock blow up, and there's plenty of super-shorted ones. So let's encourage the sub to grow and continue taking Wall Street up the ass  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ 

# OKAY WHAT'S HAPPENING???

**THE SHORT SQUEEZE IS PROBABLY UNDERWAY, DEFINITELY NOT DONE**

Okay, so you may have seen posts telling you to [**diamond hand to 10000 because Melvin is selling**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l60euz/theory_the_hold_is_working_and_the_squeeze_is/) and also [**decent full explanations**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5x0fc/gme_endgame/). These pretty much catch you up to what's happening with GME, but to summarize if you have a goldfish attention span and/or IQ: The past spikes have been gamma squeezes, because when the price goes up, calls make you buy stocks on friday, and when lots of people buy, stonks go up. Short sellers borrow stock, currently at ludicrously high interest, so they can functionally sell stocks they don't own. Soon Melvin (and other short sellers) will have negative money and be forced to buy back stock to cover their loans - when that happens, they *MUST* buy, no matter how pricey it is. GME üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ, and also, the longer everyone waits the more Melvin has to cover, so üíéüñêüíéüñêüíéüñêüíéüñê.

Here's the problem: that second post also tells you NOT to get caught up, NOT to look for the next GME, and even to get out at 384 tops if you're not committed. And that's decent advice, but...

üßªüôèüèª **ARE SELLING, KILLING MOMENTUM**

What these aren't saying is that paper hands *are* crippling the rocket. We were up to 200+ off Daddy Musk's tweet, and 5M volume later, we're... back to 200ish (as of 8 am EST). Look at the pattern on previous premarkets - we've dropped off a cliff *way* sooner than expected. This should have been expected - WSB is only a fraction (I've seen 8%, pretty sure that was an extension of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6jjm3/wsb_owns_58_of_gme_gme_survey_update/) survey, whatever, point is &lt;10%) of the market. Even if everyone here held like your wife holds her boyfriend, there's only so much we can do when [**Shitron and Melvin fake selling and coordinate attacks**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l62obe/warning_more_manipulation_on_this_sub_by_gme/) (read the comments on how impossible this is).

# HOW TO SLAUGHTER THE SHORTS

Okay, so that's a lot of boner-killing news, and if I couldn't give you back your erection, I wouldn't have said it. Here's the good news: I'm going to make you harder than ever. Because the fix is easy: Make this shit blow up.

Yes, many of you are whining about relative infants ruining the threads. Yes, bigger subreddits lose quality. Here's the thing: We can try to make WSB retarded again by cutting out normal people, but mods have already said automod is shitting itself from 30-45 days of ban, and we clearly want like 3+ months. The cat is out of the bag. The better alternative: we can make *everyone* retarded. Then, even if nobody is literate enough to read the DD, it's at least verifiable by the dozen people with braincells here.

**SO GET DD TO THE FRONT PAGE**

Also, to be clear, we're not talking galaxy brain, 40 hour-a-week DD. We're talking the basic facts of the stock. I can't tell you how many people I've heard say ""hurr durr it's just a bubble"" or ""short squeeze happened, too late"", because they didn't know there were still *over 100% shorts* **(**[**IT'S STILL TRUE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l642ms/updated_jan_27th_short_interest_data_posted_by_s3/)**)**. Boomers are scarred by 2008 and just can't believe this is really happening. This is not me selling a story, this is literally just saying ""get the basic facts to everyone"". Because that's how these short sellers make a buck - they count on 99% of the population being totally ignorant of the facts.

Now, imagine people watched r/stocks like they did r/sports. And we all knew to turn off lending on our shares, and to exercise call options on friday instead of selling them. At 1/2 the subs, that'd still be quadruple the current sub count - even by a [month old estimate](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6jjm3/wsb_owns_58_of_gme_gme_survey_update/) we had 6% of the stock, so even being conservative on every part of this back-of-the-envelope calculation we could hit 20%. It'd be like 200% of the currentüíéüñêüíéüñê even if half the new retards don't go all in. And the best part?

**WE'RE ALREADY DOING IT**

This sub is blowing up. It hit the front page (more or less) multiple times this week. If you idiots get anything RESEMBLING idiot-proof DD to the front page, we're good. GMEüåïüåïüåï's 10 times harder. And I *know* you autists can do it. DFV's an ass-hair away from 100k upvotes, and rising.

# WHY THIS SAVES WSB

**REDDIT CAN'T DUMP THE 'TARDS IF WE'RE ALL RICH TARDS**

Now here's the trick. We all are pissed at CNBC for lying to manipulate the market, but *also* [faking accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4zg6g/one_of_us_on_cnbc_quirkymushroom_you_famous_bro/) (see top comment) and painting us as [organized and thus liable](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html) (CNBC link, click at your own risk). Now there's a 0% chance the SEC is gonna knock down your door (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l562zq/its_official_stop_freaking_out_about_the_media/)) but there is a decent chance Reddit decides this is too much and neuters us ([this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3igst/dont_go_full_retard_think_about_what_you_comment/) guy's a degenerate but he's not wrong).

The whole point is that Reddit will ban a small percentage of its user base if it creates a large amount of legal trouble. Emphasis on **SMALL** percentage. WSB might be celebrating (or whining about) hitting 2 million, but that's not even in the top 100 subs. If people realize it's giving good information on good money, though... not only could that make the sub huge, it also means all the newly minted retard millionaires have all the money in the world to gild the next DFV. If we take over enough, we stop being a autism-infected fingernail for Reddit to clip, and start being the whole damn arm. At that point, they've gotta just take the free publicity and roll with it.

# WHY THIS GETS US THE NEXT GME

**GME IS ONLY THE BEGINNING**

Here's the trick. GME may be at 140% shorted, and it's getting a *great* run. But why stop there? [This](https://www.barrons.com/articles/another-gamestop-here-are-the-next-10-most-shorted-small-caps-51611688092) link (use incognito if it says to login) shows some pretty damn high short ratios, and if you look at, say, [LGND](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/lgnd), it's got several other factors making it a prime Wall Street Whaling target - a HUGE put-to-call ratio, relatively high (\~40%) ownership by hedge funds, and if you look at the graph, it looks like it's already spiking. But that's *not* to say you should jump on it, assuming it's the next train (THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, I am not a financial advisor, blah blah blah). The point is that *very* casually, just by googling shit, you can find hugely vulnerable short positions. **And then, if enough people are aware of the facts, ANY of them will be as big as GME.** Yes, GME was the perfect storm, which was why nothing like this has happened in a decade... but it's the perfect storm to *open* pandora's box. Now that it's open, the world is starting to realize the power of ü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶ç.

Not only that, once we infect Reddit, we can actually start infecting **EVERYONE ELSE**. Already we've seen boomer parents caught in our grasp - soon, they'll make millions, and they can start telling *their* boomer contacts. This isn't some millennial only club - everyone, from zoomer to boomer, can find an excuse to join. Some will say it's enforcing the complete information requirement of a truly free market. Some will say it's forcibly taking money from the ultra-rich who don't deserve it. But **EVERYBODY LIKES MONEY**, and everybody but the hedge funds likes taking from the hedge funds. And more importantly, this is an incredibly unique opportunity - because for once, sharing means **MORE MONEY** for you, not less.

# TL;DR

Let WSB get huge and then ANYONE can spend 2 seconds researching the next GME. This is how we keep WSB alive. This is how we all get rich. This is how we take ALL the money from ALL the short selling, market manipulating, micro-penis hedge funds.

I know this isn't a GME post but it may be a great place to roll some tendies when GameStop hits $1000 on Friday. GME could actually hit $1000 Friday.

First, check the chart. Today CRSR is up 5% even while the broader market ate shit at open. Buyers came in hot.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img wezfmmez6wd61...*

After peaking at $51, The stock pulled back smartly. Since then, CRSR has been consolidating while setting higher highs and higher lows every couple of weeks. 

$CRSR had a non-dilutive offering last week at $35 per share. This didn't add shares, just gave their initial PE firm a chance to cash out. With 7M shares sold at $35, this built a solid new ""floor"" for the stock on high volume at $35. Corsair easily digested this move and broke out to $40 before pulling back a bit today. Personally I used today as a chance to sell $25k in puts and buy $25k in calls for Feb 19. Will add more calls on any weakness for the rest of the week.

What does this have in common with GME? Corsair has 36% short interest (obviously lower than GME), but the main IPO lock up period doesn't expire til March. Corsair's current available float is only 20% of total shares outstanding while short interest is 36%. Not a lot of shares available for shorts to cover if the stock starts moving against them.

Last week LOGI crushed earnings, and I fully expect CRSR to do the same. I'm planning to sell the calls pre-earnings if CRSR runs $45+, but won't be buying to close the puts until near expiration. Assuming CRSR outperforms, it could break out above $50 and beyond. Worth a look imo. Always GME TO THE MOON, but this could be the next play.

40,l66q1m,What prevents a GME situation from happening again with a different company?,14,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm totally a novice when it comes to investing and financial analysis, but it‚Äôs fucking amazing that you‚Äôre bleeding billionaires and collapsing hedge funds, like this is both the funniest and actually inspiring shit I‚Äôve ever seen.

From what I understand, some keen Redditors realized that institutional powers were shorting Gamestop and then started to short squeeze, where they bought and encouraged others to buy GME to raise its value and fuck over the short holders and make some crazy profit. The billionaires saw Gamestop as failing since nobody really needs a brick and mortar video game store, and tried to make a profit, and now they‚Äôre losing. So here‚Äôs my question -

What stops WSB from doing this over and over again? Like, does anything stop WSB from finding some new company with a low value and a bunch of shorts and initiating a new short squeeze and encouraging everyone to invest? This sub has 2.4 million people, so I was just wondering why this hasn‚Äôt happened before (at least to this scale or publicity) and if anything stops it from happening again. Are there any laws about financial collusion or something like that, because if you could consistently get like 100000 people to participate in a short squeeze you could spike the stock value and fuck over the billionaires consistently, right? Like I said idk shit about this so lmk how this works lol

43,l66q8w,Letter to my Representatives in Congress supporting WSB,0,"  

Thank you for representing me, my family, and my community, and the United States.

I‚Äôm writing you concerning the latest news regarding certain stocks (GameStop, AMC, Blackberry, Express, etc) and the groundswell movement from millions of everyday Americans that is driving these prices up. They are buying stocks they believe in. Make no mistake, they are heroes despite how the ""professional investor"" tries to position this situation in the media.

The villain(s) in this situation is the Hedge Funds that systematically ‚Äúshort‚Äù stocks. Here‚Äôs how it works, and why THEY are the problem: They take their client‚Äôs stocks and sell them (often without their customer‚Äôs knowledge). They then put out publicity and ‚Äúopinion pieces‚Äù about how that company / stock is horrible and not worth the price. They are bashing fellow Americans and the American Companies they work for. They do this to intentionally influence the market and drive the prices down. When these stock prices go down, they then buy the stocks back at the lower price, put them back into their customer‚Äôs accounts (again, without their customer‚Äôs knowledge) and pocket the difference. The customer‚Äôs account value is now lower because that stock price / value is lower.

They have just stolen from their customers and the American People. THIS is what we need you and our Government to investigate. 

You must take a position. You can take the side of the everyday Americans that believe in these American Companies and the American Workers that these stocks represent. Or, you will be on the side of those trashing and belittling these American Companies and American Workers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l66q8w/letter_to_my_representatives_in_congress/,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

56,l66tmx,"Buy CRSR before Feb 9 Earnings. Low Float Due to Lock Up, High Short Interest, Should Crush Earnings",31,"Tl;dr: Buy CRSR calls for earnings run up. I know this isn't a GME post but it may be a great place to roll some tendies when GameStop hits $1000 on Friday. GME could actually hit $1000 Friday.

First, check the chart. Today CRSR is up 5% even while the broader market ate shit at open. Buyers came in hot.

After peaking at $51, The stock pulled back smartly. Since then, CRSR has been consolidating while setting higher highs and higher lows every couple of weeks.

$CRSR had a non-dilutive offering last week at $35 per share. This didn't add shares, just gave their initial PE firm a chance to cash out. With 7M shares sold at $35, this built a solid new ""floor"" for the stock on high volume at $35. Corsair easily digested this move and broke out to $40 before pulling back a bit today. Personally I used today as a chance to sell $25k in puts and buy $25k in calls for Feb 19. Will add more calls on any weakness for the rest of the week.

What does this have in common with GME? Corsair has 36% short interest (obviously lower than GME), but the main IPO lock up period doesn't expire til March. Corsair's current available float is only 20% of total shares outstanding while short interest is 36%. Not a lot of shares available for shorts to cover if the stock starts moving against them.

Last week LOGI crushed earnings, and I fully expect CRSR to do the same. I'm planning to sell the calls pre-earnings if CRSR runs $45+, but won't be buying to close the puts until near expiration. Assuming CRSR outperforms, it could break out above $50 and beyond. Worth a look imo. Always GME TO THE MOON, but this could be the next play.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1.) COVID vaccine rollout has started, and we will be able to attend movies soon. The Biden Administration (sorry for getting political, just pls keep reading) has an ambitious plan (100 million vaccines in 100 days or whatever the fuck) and this pandemic is almost over. I‚Äôd give it until the end of the year.

2.) **Most** [**AMC**](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-ent-movie-theaters-reopening-0123-2021) **theatres** [**are open**](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean#locations) or they are planning to open soon with social distancing and mask measures in place. They will shut down the food services and concessions, but they are coming back.

3.) **Consumers have a sentimental connection to movies. They will come back**. People are starved for the outside world and will come out in massive hordes to watch movies. People will go out and see movies, take their kids, go on dates, etc. Nothing can replicate the experience of a giant screen and surround audio.

4.) This major influx of blue balled movie goers will cause a major boost in 2021. Then we will see a continuation of the year over year growth we have been seeing since 2012.

5.) The AMC business model is working. The revenue has steadily increased since 2012 year over year. [**In 2012, they made $811 million. In 2019, they made $5.47 billion.**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206959/revenue-of-amc-theatres/) There has been a steady rise. **THEY ARE NOT IN DECLINE.**

6.) I understand they have many loans, but it is something that can be paid off in a few years with the help of their parent company, Wanda Entertainment, and increased profits in 2021.

7.) They will not go bankrupt. WANDA entertainment, a Chinese company owns the plurality share (20%) and will bail them out if it is necessary. They bought for $2.6 billion in 2012, and have seen a ROI, scoring $2.7 billion in 2013, the year immediately after their purchase. AMC is too good of an asset for Wanda to lose them. Also, AMC can take advantage of new stimulus and other government assistance programs.

8.) It‚Äôs extremely cheap right now because everybody is shorting, and there‚Äôs a pandemic. Corona is only temporary. Everybody thought GameStop was going to go under, until we showed them. Remember that.

9.) If there is interest or heightened trading in the stock, AMC can dilute shares and sell them to help finance operations and pay debt, using stock sales as leverage. AMC just did this today, and they can do it again if needed.

10.) AMC will not go bankrupt, not only because of the potential Wanda bailout, but [**they also raised $917 million today. They have enough runway to stay operational the end of the year. ""Bankruptcy is off the table for now.""**](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/25/amc-ceo-adam-aron-on-917m-financing.html) (We should be able to return to theatres by then.) A slight majority of this new liquidity comes from issuing new shares, as described in 9. They are also planning to do debt/equity swaps, so those who take out debt can hold shares in the company, and AMC won't get fucked over by high loan payments.

11.) [**AMC is about 70% shorted**](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)**, there is much potential to cause a squeeze**. However, there are still many more reasons to invest in AMC beyond a simple short squeeze.

12.) AMC does very well when it is not pandemic. $5.4 billion in revenue last year, and there will be many movies, as well as many moviegoers that come out after the pandemic. Especially with major franchise movies, which have been delayed. They [have also reached a deal with Universal, which allows Universal to do home releases earlier, but stipulates they must be in theatres for 17 days before that.](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-amc-deal-theaters-pandemic-1234801134/)

13.) AMC is only $5 a share right now... Even if it loses, you‚Äôre not going to lose much. Meanwhile, the ceiling is high, and there is much potential. If you want in, do it now while it's cheap. People keep talking about how dumb it is to buy during the pandemic, but this is the point of largest potential. Don't wait for the recovery to buy.

14.) AMC used to trade at $10 before the pandemic. Let‚Äôs bring it back to its former glory. AMC deserves a $1bn market cap and they will get one. They will probably hit $7 tomorrow (predicting $10 by Feb1, peak in summer with COVID all done.).

15.) Even though the Net income is negative and they lose money, it consistently stays in the hundred thousands range, and it does not lose that much. Any autist on here from GME could pay the difference. [**AMC has also increased gross profits year over year, from 2,004,200 in 2016, to 3,493,200.**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc)

*(The rest of these bullet points are just jokes, so feel free to skip if you want.)*

16.) Without AMC there‚Äôs no place to spend my AMC points, and there better be a place for me to spend those points because I invested my entire life savings into those damn AMC stubs.

17.) Going to the movies was my childhood. We must save my childhood. DO NOT LET AMC DIE. Save AMC.

18.) You can take ur wife and her bf to the movies when this is over.

19.) The AMC food court literally sells tendies. (But we should call AMC tendies popcorns instead.)

20.) **STONCCS only go up.**

21.) you guys are all retard who cannot think for themselves and will do whatever is echoed in this fucking internet cave.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR : AMC has done a great job with fundraising and can survive until the end of the year. Vaccine rollout has started, and recovery is coming soon. People are due to return to movies. About 70% of shares are shorted, so we can potentially trigger a squeeze.

# Pandemic recovery &amp; squeeze combo.

**If you‚Äôre with us, let's save the movies. I hope you like popcorn. Get on the rocket, because you're going to the moon.**

78,l6778p,Citadel is screwing with GME via Robinhood,4,"Step 0: Citadel pays Robinhood for order flow. Citadel gets to see RH's orders a few milliseconds before they're filled. Citadel may choose to front-run some of those trades.

Step 1: RH's customers and WallStreetBets start manipulating $GME. This is happening in the open.

Officially, they're manipulating $GME (and $BB and $KOSS) because these low-value stocks are being very heavily shorted, and if something moves the value of the stock up (like, tens of thousands of retail investors acting in near unison), those short-sellers may be forced to sell to cover their borrowed shares. If most shares are held by retail investors who won't sell, the price will skyrocket (supply/demand) until someone does. The bear hedge funds and such will still have to buy to cover, which may cause a bit of a liquidity crisis for the funds.

The concept of ""Screw the hedge fund vampires who exist only to destroy companies like Gamestop"" is a big part of /r/WallStreetBets's messaging.  It's a compelling message, and a decent secondary reason for this.

The primary reason to manipulate markets remains profit, though.

Step 2:  HFTs buy shares ahead of Robinhood users.

Remember Citadel, the firm who can front-run robinhood trades, and got to see all of that RH data a little early because they paid for flow? Yeah. When do you think they started buying $GME in front of RH traders on momentum?

Because the volume of shares exchanged suggests that the HFT folks were all over this, all the way to $150. The message on WSB might be ""lots of little guys screwing big Wall Street"", but the truth is that the HFT robots were screwing everyone, while paying RobinHood a kickback.

Step 3:  A hedge fund becomes insolvent. Today it was Melvin Capital Management.  It very likely won't be the last.

Melvin immediately sells off a portion of itself, because it needs the influx of cash or it will vanish in a poof of smoke, vaporizing ~$15 Billion in the process.

Step 4: Who's the lead investor, picking up part of a usually successful fund at fire-sale prices?

Right. Citadel, probably with some of the cash they made by repeatedly profiting in the milliseconds before filling the trades that collapsed this fund.

Step 5:  Citadel still has access to RH order flows, is still allowed to front-run them and/or pocket the spread, and can use that and other information to determine the next over-leveraged fund that's going to get squeezed.

They might even be able to accelerate the squeeze.

So, the next time you discount the impact of ""4chan with a bloomberg terminal"", remember that they are not the only ones who stand to benefit from intentionally screwing exposed short-sellers.

The professionals are all too happy to amplify the efforts of the amateurs for profit.

Because if amateurs manipulate the market, uh, truthfully, then nobody loses their license.

""I (retail investor) bought because I hate Citron &amp; hedge funds, and we're going to screw them for profit. Join us, but do your own due diligence. YOLO!"" might just be legal. IANAL.

If a licensed broker/dealer did this, they'd lose their license, and probably go to jail.  Martha Stewart did time for less.

But Citadel, by paying for order flow and sitting in the middle, gets to legally ride-along, printing money the whole way.

So, when you ask yourself, ""who pays for no-commission trades, and why?"" or ""what's the harm of RobinHood's business model?"", take a look at what happens behind the scenes, in the milliseconds after you press buy, but before you own those shares.

It's vampires all the way down.

Verbatim from:
https://twitter.com/toxic/status/1353890766800621569?s=21

80,l677ky,"How to Make Upwards of 1000%+ Returns With Lower Risk, Yearly Call Options (The Smart Autist Way)",3,"I understand you retards only care about üöÄ and autistic short term options but here me out. Blackberry, Ford, Nokia, GME. What do these stocks all have in common? They all started off 2020 with low volatility or decreasing stock price, suddenly they swing up. If you invested $1000 into January 2022 call options for GameStop at its lowest point in 2020 ($5/share), you could have somewhere around $400,000-500,000 right now ($250/share)

How does this work? Well options have premiums based on the implied volatility of the stock itself (stocks that moves sideways have much lower options premiums than a high volatility stock). You can take advantage of this by buying long term expiry options (LEAPs) at relatively lost low cost with respect to the stock price. In a nutshell, find stocks that have been trading sideways for ages but more recently have gained huge growth potential.

# Example, please skip this if you‚Äôre a super autist

Let‚Äôs say Nokia is at trading at $4/share, it‚Äôs been priced on average at $4/share for the past 2 years. Its implied volatility is very low, so short volatility sellers (people who write the call/put contracts) are more willing to sell contracts at cheaper prices.

In this case a call option with a strike price of $5 for January 2022 trades at $0.3/share or $30 per contract.  The contract seller is assuming that Nokia won‚Äôt break past the strike price + premium ($5+$0.3 =$5.3) by January 2022.  This options contract is SUPER cheap, just compare the ratio of (share price)/(option premium) = 4/0.3 \~= 12. Right now GME is trading at $77/share and a $110 January 2022 call option is $35/share. Thus, GME‚Äôs (share price)/(option premium) ratio $77/$35 = 2.2. That‚Äôs a vast difference in the cost of the option with respect to the stock price between GME and Nokia.

However after just a $0.6 increase in Nokia‚Äôs stock on January 25th, 2021 ($4.2/share-&gt; $4.8/share), $5 January 2022 Nokia calls rose from ($0.3/share -&gt; $1.2/share) = 300% return.  The ratio of (share price)/(option premium) = 4.8/1.2 \~= 4. Which indicates that Nokia leaps are suddenly priced wayyy higher due to an increase in implied volatility of the stock.

If Nokia let‚Äôs say goes from $4/share to $20/share by 2022, the VALUE of the options contract COULD go from let‚Äôs say $0.3/share/contract to let‚Äôs say $15/share/contract depending on the Vega of the stock. That would be a 5000% return ($15/$0.3 = 50x) of your capital.

# How is this ‚ÄúLower Risk‚Äù?

\- Worst case scenario:  you buy yearly call options and the stock continues to move in the opposite way than the one you predicted and/or stays stagnant. So what? You can sell the call option if you feel that your judgement was wrong and gain back a significant portion of your premium, as opposed to weekly options where if you miss the mark, game over.

\- Best case scenario: non linear returns (1% - infinity%) . If your low volatility stock suddenly rockets up over the year or two, well then you‚Äôve earned more tickets to tendie town.

\- If you wanna play with high volatility stocks, might as well buy shares as the risk to reward ratio simply isn‚Äôt worth it.

# Summary of What to Look For

1. Look for companies with low implied volatility but ridiculously high growth potential (think Nokia, Blackberry, Ford)

2. H Y P E Potential.  GameStop, Nio, Palantir. All these stocks were shunned at first but when they gained hype, they touch the moon. If you bought calls for these companies when they were trading cheap, you'd be a rich MF.

3. Stocks with high liquidity. Don‚Äôt employ this strategy on low market cap stocks (less than $1billion imo), great way to be a bag holder most of the time. If you're bullish on these sorts of stocks, load up shares instead

4. Keep track at the average volume of trading with respect to shares outstanding, the more active a company is traded, the more likely it is to rocket. By keeping track of the velocity of shares being traded, you can somewhat predict whether a stock is likely to rocket because more people want to get in.

5. Solid fundamentals (low debt, profitable, high book value)

6. Pro Tip: DON‚ÄôT BE A RETARDED SHORT VOLATILITY SELLER (writing call/put options) UNLESS YOU CAN HEDGE YOUR POSITION WITH SHARES. These strategies have liner gains (option premiums) but potential non-linear losses (stock suddenly plummets or moons in opposite direction of the option, i.e GME Short Squeeze).

TLDR; Don‚Äôt be a full retard, invest in CHEAP long term options (leaps) on companies with historical low implied volatility but huge growth potential. Stocks to look out for $NOK, $LUMN, $ERIC, .

The suits fucked up, this was never about the fundamentals of the company, P/E, balance sheet, cash flow, this was a big fuck you to those dumb enough to short a stock so much that when Gamestop bought its shares back the short % was 140, simple math, no enough stocks more demand price goes up  (I'm new on Reddit so Rocket x 1000).   

This is only the beginning, they're people stupid enough that still are shorting because you know, is a Gamestop pump, right? 

The only thing that can stop the bleeding is that you start selling or Gamestop issuing new stock.

And to those that are buying puts below 50$ with expiration 6 months from now, do you think that after this the valuation of the company is going to stay the same? Big cash reserves, lowering debt, transforming into ecommerce, you do know that Gamestop haves more than 25% of shares, and they bought it at 4$. 

Think about that.

94,l67dte,Noob trader question: AMC or GME? I only have $430 to invest,21,"I'm kind of new at this, so please excuse my inexperience.

I heard about the GME news yesterday, but thought the hype had mostly fizzled out (now seeing this sub, I find that to not be true lol)
But this morning, I heard about AMC rising. So I bought in with $900, was profitting $250, then it dropped to profitting $60 when the markets opened. Now AMC is back down again and Gamestop is being super volatile, going from $260 to $320 repeatedly.
And my $900 has to settle from me investing in AMC then selling, leaving me with $430 free to invest

So, my question is: As someone with not that much money, what should I do?

Would it be better to invest into AMC's hype, hoping it can reach what Gamestop has, making my money increase by 20x. Or invest in GameStop's hype, just for the hype to die soon or die when it hits $1000, only increasing my money by 4x. I don't have the money to buy low, sell high repeatedly. I can only do this every other day. 

Or alternatively

I invest in AMC, only for it's price to double, hit a ceiling, and only double my money when I could've invested in Gamestop and get 4x my money for **WHEN** it hits $1000.

(Side note: I say $1000 for gamestop, because I know that's the going goal. I know some people on here say $5000 or to just keep holding and never sell, but I, personally don't see it hitting $5000. That's just so much for a failing company. $1000 is a lot, but I can see retard strength overcoming that.
