Watching the MSM shit on grassroots autists shows just how in bed they are with these hedge funds and wall street. They continue to try and downplay and discredit the pure autism that is this subreddit.

 I have been a long time lurker of WSB and have noticed several points:

1. There are a lot of very smart, VERY autistic people in this thread that give incredible DD; and
2. There are TENS OF THOUSANDS of hype-beasts that are itching to YOLO their entire bank account into stonks. If the DD fits, we sits.

I couldn't be MORE HYPED for all you degenerates in GME (I paper handed hard, in at $40, out at $111. I'm a bitch, I know).

Make me proud, show these pretentious 'journalists' and fat cats just how powerful the retail trader is.

28,l66586,Sue Bae has a sister E Bae (EBAY),5,"Now you’ve all heard of Sue Bae, but what about her estranged sister E Bae? She once was a darling of the e-commerce world, but over the years has slowly drifted into the shadows amongst the giants of Amazon, Walmart and Shopify. Back in 2002 she met a man from South Africa (I’d put his name but half this sub would cum) and took PayPal under her wing. For 13 years she helped PayPal grow, until one day PayPal even outshined E Bae herself. She’s been growing steadily ever since. 

Fast forward 6 years to 2020, where Covid has struck and everything has been going out of stock. Well, E Bae has taken full advantage - even hosting listings of Sue Bae’s products at multiples above the retail price - all the while taking a hefty 10% cut. She’s primed for a beat.

E Bae is currently sitting pretty with a P/E of only between 7-8, a whole magnitude lower than competitors yet still growing in both revenue and users. Recently in 2021, support for payment options other than PayPal were added. Relatively undervalued given the current economic climate when looking at competitors like Etsy, Amazon etc but what do I know. Most importantly, calls are cheap.

MSFT, AMD and (probably NVDA) have had blowout quarters, with record sales in console and pc markets respectively. As many of you are well aware, these components were and still are always “out of stock” at most e-commerce and brick and mortar stores, including at the fabled GME. The exceeding demand for such components has contributed to a surge in secondary markets like EBAY to the likes of which has never been seen, particularly in Q4.

I put all the money I did have in GME around $97/ share &amp; AMC at $4.84 Tuesday morning (a little less than $1k) with an exit plan to get out once I had enough for his surgery.

Will this happen again?  I talked to my girlfriend just now and she wants in too, we're both late 30s with some cash to fuck some billionaires up.  We're going to load up the cash in the brokerage accounts and ready to pull the trigger.

&amp;#x200B;

I WANT GOD DAMN TENDIES TOO?  WHAT IS A TENDIE?  IS IT A CHICKEN FINGER BUT ACTUALLY MONEY?  LOL!

I started getting into trading a few years ago in order to jump on what I saw to be a great opportunity (NET, got some good tendies from that one), and as of this week I've sold the majority of my shares for it and will be converting those gains into GME. I previously bought a few shares when it was at $80, but I was still a smooth brained simp then and didn't go all in...I have brought great shame to my dynasty for that failing. Only now do I recognize the experience and wisdom of this den of retards.

I still remain smoothed brain though, as I do hold a few hundred NOK (I had it on my radar before all this ruckus, and bought in partially just in case for a long term hold NOT TO THE MOON!), but at this point in my life you just can't fix stupid.
