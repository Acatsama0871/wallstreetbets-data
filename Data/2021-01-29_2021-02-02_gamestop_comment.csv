Who is the DTC? They are the ones the brokers go through. 95% of trading on the market go through these guys. When investors accounts go negative and they can't pay the broker has to settle when the broker can't pay because the loss was so big The DTC then has to cover. He is basically saying nobody can cover what is about to happen and The DTC are on the phones right now nonstop asking banks to help them cover in the short term like JP Morgan and others. He is saying the whole Market is insolvent currently because brokers have 2 day clearing cycles that go through DTC aka the clearing houses. It's why some brokers could sell GME &amp; AMC and some couldn't. Places that were able to sell yesterday just had their cycles cleared and could afford to sell GME by having the cash on hand. They didn't have to clear the shit storm that has just happened to GME and AMC in the last few days still. The DTC were the ones who called brokerages and said we literally CAN""T sell even if we wanted to.

At the very least they could have stopped all purchases and sales for 30 mins to 1 hr.

However, a quick review of past history makes me think all participants in this debacle will get a slap on the wrist. That's why I advocate for switching to another brokerage, since we have no control over the regulatory response -- we do have control over who we do business with and how we vote with our dollars.

For example, the SEC hitting RH with a $20 million fine is nothing compared to them losing 50% of their userbase.

Maybe then they'll realize who they're truly supposed to be serving -- their end user not the HFT paying their bills."

2. high short interest that was always there because of WallStreet’s ego

227,l7my7b,gl7oa7h,"I have limited knowledge and full disclosure, I'm very new to all of this and have been holding onto my measly 2 shares of GME for dear life to be a part of history. I have been wanting out of RH since what they pulled today, but the other brokers I've tried opening accounts with take at least 3 days for approval.

Now, my question:

what are the odds that RH does something as insane as freezing all trading on their app. just not allowing retail traders to sell their shares. My reasoning: they are beholden to Citadel. Citadel's money is worth way more to Robinhood than what the retail traders have. 

What would happen if RH just halts all trading, buying and selling, not just for tomorrow but for the next couple of days. They KNOW now that people are immediately pulling their money from RH the moment they can, so why wouldnt they save their relationship financially with citadel?

anyone have any answers? - a concerned ape with diamond hands."
