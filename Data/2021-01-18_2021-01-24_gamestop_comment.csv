1,kzotqk,gk4se3q,"Just do ITM debit spread of like 30-35 for the next 1 week, your breakeven will be around $33 and if GME closes above $35 next week you gain up to 50% of ur initial. repeat this until this retarded obssesion with GME stops"
2,gjsgzwi,gjsho2t,"well, I use robinhood. Easier and cleaner user-interface. So I don't have a clue of what you are talking about."
3,gjq2vwt,gjsgzwi,"Full spectrum tard, here. The only reason I haven't bought options yet is because I can't actually figure out how to on my broker (fidelity) .. I click Options and then get like 56009340 choices, when I click one of those, I get another bunch of choices at which point I nope the fuck back out."
4,kzotqk,gjs6kdz,"My issue with the April calls is when mine became deep itm last week, they didn't trade enough to really follow the share price and volume was low making them kind of a steal for the autist that bought em from me."

Maybe Ill do it with BB instead"

15,gjq1ydv,gjq2vwt,"My fellow autist, from what I have have gather here is that you certainly can lose all your money in a couple of Option Trades (and I've only been here 9 days) so, me personally, I'll stay off options because ""there"" is no ""normal"".

27,gjpezxr,gjpjbc5,Where are you seeing April calls? Td and webull go from March to June as options
28,gjpil0c,gjpj724,"We're all retarded here, but IV is kind of subjective. First you might want to compare it to the volatility of the market, and also the historic volatility of the option. A good rule of thumb is if the price jumped recently, the IV is probably high. Fun fact IV is overstated 85% of the time and the higher the IV the more overstated it tends to be according to tasty works, which is why it makes sense to sell FDs when IV is at it's peak. I would say in this market a low IV is up to 60% roughly."
29,gjp5ed7,gjpil0c,"What constitutes low vs high IV, in your opinion? Ballpark numbers...

I ask bc I'm tarded"

34,kzotqk,gjp63m8,What are those purple and yellow crayon lines on the chart?
35,kzotqk,gjp5ed7,"Weeklies are mostly fine only if you understand that you have an allotted window, and if you hold onto them until expiry, you're opening yourself up to major damage. I do biweeklies and look to sell on an upswing and then open a new one on the next down tick at the next week's expiry. I always sell at least 3 days before expiry, but I'm always looking for an exit. In a high IV environment you want to avoid exposure to IV contraction, so shorter term options will give you better flexibility to open at those lower IV. For new people, what you're suggesting is very good though.  


For more clarification, as a seller, I look to sell in high IV environments, and I'll sell about 45 days out for maximum P/L. Though weeklies will have a higher W%, the P/L matters more to me because I'm never overexposed. (except on GME)  Now if we believe that to be the best set up possible, then what we should extrapolate is that for buyers, where that parabolic function is beneficial to sellers, it will be an inverted parabolic function for buyers. So we want to look at low IV environments (obviously) and date ranges both closer and further out from that 45 DTE mark.  


The reason W% is higher but P/L is lower for sellers doing weeklies (still net positive I believe), is because usually when they're wrong, they're wrong bigly. And for once I believe that they'll be wrong bigly, the set up looks too good for my calls not to print this week, though I will be either rolling them out or selling them before friday."

50,kzphxt,gjs1vrl,The title is very gay bear.
51,gjpluoz,gjs0a1t,"Re: operating costs

They are closing underperforming stores quickly (11% in last year) at minimal cost due to short average lease terms of only 2 years. 40% of leases are up in the next year. The revenue transfer from closed stores to remaining nearby stores is about 40%, so closures are improving margins. Sherman has made huge strides in better working capital management, carrying less inventory, etc. He cut SG&amp;A by 1/3 in the last year. Also, RC is a self-described fanatic about costs.

Re: debt

They are in a net cash position. They only have about $360 million in debt outstanding ($73MM bond this March, two $25MM French term loans later in 2021, the $25MM on the revolver, and $216MM bond due in 2023), versus $475MM in cash. Bond market prices all their bonds above par, so is not worried about BK at all. They generate free cash flow, and will have no problem paying down this debt. The rest of the ‚Äúdebt‚Äù you see on stat sites like Yahoo or SA is lease obligations. Since the leases are short term and it‚Äôs cash flow positive, these aren‚Äôt really like debt... the leases will be paid as operating costs.

Position: 8500 shares"

My wicked stepmother thinks my lemonade stand will fail and she wants to profit from my loss. She gets a loan from the prince for lemons at $5/lemon and sells them to me thinking I would have to sell them back to her at a loss when I fail. I did not fail. My lemonade sells so well that the lemon prices go up to $35/lemon. The prince being rich and shrewd, has a store of lemons he is now selling for more than before. Since prices of lemons are high during this short window of high demand, the prince tells everyone who got lemon loans they need to return his lemons so he can sell them on the market so he can take his huge profit. Wicked stepmother must now return the original lemons to the prince or end up with their head on a pike. Well there are no lemons to be found at $35/ and so she goes to the prince to tell him she will pay him the market rate for lemons. He says the market rate is $1000/lemon, pay it or be executed for failing to pay debts. Meanwhile I‚Äôm squeezing lemons enjoying the fact that she‚Äôs either dead or destitute from the great lemon squeeze of 2021."
58,gjqms10,gjrbl13,Thank you for your response. Also that's a very valuable comment about what the big dogs did half a year ago.

There are ideas obviously but they‚Äôre only thesis‚Äôs until it actually happens. 

Keep in mind that a year ago, people with a lot more experience in the market than anyone here bet hundreds of millions of dollars that GME would go bankrupt. Which is obviously a good thing for us now but it should serve as a reminder that it‚Äôs, at least possibly, a bad idea to get too specific about predicting the market.

94,gjqhved,gjqmb6p,"That's pretty speculative IMO, and I don't know for sure that it's realistic. GME might benefit from the esports boom but I don't suppose it'll be because they host in-person events - lots of more focused startups are already capitalizing on this. It's true that GME already has the locations though, so who's to say really. Might add some surprise upside in the future (1-2+ years) but I wouldn't bet on it"

116,gjqdluj,gjqe29c,"There is a chance, but if that happens, your order most likely won‚Äôt get filled anyway. The price when the market opens won‚Äôt be what it is right now. So if you have an order in now to buy 4K in shares at its current price it may work out a few different ways:

The price actually does open about the same as it is now, and your order is fine. Probably won‚Äôt happen, the price is more likely around 40 right now than what it‚Äôs showing. 

The price opens higher, and your order doesn‚Äôt go through

The price opens lower, and you overpay for the shares.

128,gjq91kq,gjq9r5w,"To this I add the problem that in the video games industry, the ongoing trend has been for independent publishers and big name developers to either sell their games through digital distribution systems like Steam or their own proprietary distribution systems like Nintendo shop or PlayStation online, Xbox Live store, etc. For now all of these projections seem cool and all, but qualitatively speaking, I don't see why Nintendo Sony and Microsoft would allow GameStop in the long run to take a cut out of their own digital distribution-based profits. So GameStop will be left with used game sales for majority of profits. This is why they keep referring to GameStop as a blockbuster. In other words, wouldn't you rather invest in Netflix (the major distributer and producer of media) rather than on blockbuster (trying to reduce brick and mortar, and move online)? Similar situation here for GameStop vs Nintendo, Xbox, PlayStation, Steam. Also GameStop has to compete with Walmart, Bestbuy and other retailers including Amazon! The other day I bought a Mario game off Amazon because it was cheaper than on GameStop."

I made a post about the MOASS-side PT on this as well, and I made sure to emphasize to our GME brothers that the more we wait, then the higher the potential squeeze price due to the organic growth that will happen even before a squeeze in itself, i. e. a positive change in price by way of the market catching up to fair value. The sheer undervaluation of GME as it stands right now is quite remarkable, even more so now that RC is at the helm; and WSB got a front-row VIP pass to the best seats in the show by way of early-adopter discount prices."

148,kzsz8j,gjpqg8d,"Back before Netflix was doing streaming, in 2000, Blockbuster actually did it first. They partnered with Enron, of all companies, to provide a set-top-box that streamed video content directly to the customer's TV over the internet. It had some of the latest movies but eventually failed when Enron pulled the plug a year after the deal as they weren't confident Blockbuster could provide enough content.

Blockbuster also had an opportunity to buy Netflix for $50m in 2000 but turned the offer down.

I'd argue that it wasn't strictly a change in consumer behaviour that ultimately killed Blockbuster - it was mostly because it was badly run and failed to keep up with that consumer behaviour that led to their demise."

176,gjpy1hz,gjpyv0w,"I don't know a lot of these things myself, could be multiple reasons from what I gather:

&gt;The first, and usually most obvious, reason to explain why an institutional investor holds more than 100% of a company's shares stems from delays in updating publicly-available data. The figures released in an institution's report correspond to an institutional holding's date.¬†These dates generally differ somewhat among all of the institutions that hold a company's stock, resulting in differences that could impact the reported percentage for total institutional holdings being displayed.

src:  [How Can Institutional Holdings Be More Than 100%? (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp)

&gt;Institutional ownership can eventually exceed 100 percent of float, which means that, in addition to all the available shares, institutions have also bought up all the borrowed shares from short sellers who are betting that the stock will decline

src: [The Disadvantages of High Institutional Ownership Stocks (pocketsense.com)](https://pocketsense.com/disadvantages-high-institutional-ownership-stocks-4748.html)

I guess in GME's case it's probably the second reason."
177,gjpxyc4,gjpyggf,cmon guys... i wanna be an astronaut too
178,gjpwdnw,gjpyc4h,"ok so as seen in another comment,
i now think the WSB free float is around 10 mil. ( = 69 mil. - 27% board shares - 58% institutional shares).

is that correct?
how can i now find out, how many of these are still in bear hands? (open for sell at an exchange?)"
179,gjpxc8f,gjpy1hz,"so total shares = 69 mil.
shares by board (27%) = 19 mil.
shares by institutions acc. (58%) = 40 mil.
""free float"" = 69-19-40 = 10mil.

and how are there 122% of shares held by institutions? :(

how can i found out how many shares are available for purchase as of non, so i can tell how fked short sellers are?

(less shares to buy meaning higher prices of shares for short sellers)"
187,gjpvz73,gjpwlid,"so how  do i even know how many shares are available to buy at any given time?

i thought we need to have small amounts of buyable shares, so the price to cover shorts would go up.

That is roughly a 27% gain from current price, which is also near my cost basis so would represent my actual gain. 

Would I make more than 27% buying GME between now and then - so if purchased at say $40 tomorrow, would need to go to $50.8 for that to be a yes. Personally I think that is a yes so may pull the trigger tomorrow. If PLTR is above $26 and or GME is below $40 that would make the decision easier."

Shorters started this when GME looked like an OK toilet at best, but then Cohen and co. upgraded the toilet. Like really gave it the works: gold plating, heater seats, etc. All of a sudden everybody wants to use that sexy toilet and also (as an added bonus) to flush out the money, so the pressure is building. But the shorters didn't give up! They put more money in and more money in...and even (some suspect) threw a bunch of counterfeit money/wooden nickels in there....so it's rdy to blow."

I see a big pullback and then I've read things that say this company has no future viable model (Blockbuster comparisons). Since i've never done an option in my life (and I'm too chicken to do so), are you saying that I should load the boat on GME? What's the target price here?"
351,gjr899b,gjrkkw7,"It‚Äôs not 50% here (Canada), it‚Äôs that 50% of your capital gains are taxable as income. So you would add 50% of your gains to your income and then whatever tax tier that puts you in, would be taxed at that rate. 

So for example if you make between ~$49000 and $98000 you get taxed 20%. On a $100 profit, $50 of it would be taxed 20% so you would pay $10 in tax.  

The highest tier here is 33%, so in the ‚Äòworst case scenario‚Äô where you earn over $216,000 a year you would pay $16.5 on that same $100 profit (33% of $50, 50% of $100).

Where you have to be careful is if the capital gains push you into a higher tax tier, which is why people try to delay taxation over multiple years when possible."

460,gjquv0q,gjqwfiq,Standardization. It‚Äôs easy to tell a store to do this and that if you know without a doubt that the store will have manpower and management to do those things. Can be a blessing or a curse but this shows that the company wants a consistent experience across the board now.

Y‚Äôall are retarded.  Yeah there‚Äôs a random short squeeze.  There‚Äôs zero reason for it.  The retail industry is still dead and lost to digital downloads.  GameStop is still garbage and losing revenue, while they scapegoat it on the pandemic.  We all understand without the China cooties they‚Äôre still a garbage company.

The dying revenue will eventually catch up to the wild enthusiasm for the stock.  It‚Äôs based on nothing.  And some of you are hopeful they will turn it around and pivot to retail hardware sales.  I can‚Äôt even with this sub; I‚Äôm sure some of you are being sarcastic."

A local comic book store in my city opened a coffee shop next door and has been doing very well because of it. Give people a reason to come in and you'll see a lot more impulse buys. If you can make money WHILE giving people a reason to come in frequently, all the better."

But they'll need so stream it from steam or some other online game store (potential for GME to compete in this space) on a PC (also a good way to suck people into the msft ecosystem - 365, azure, etc.).so msft is banking on GME pushing PCs to replace the Xbox, claw back marketshare from Apple and introduce people to Azure."

666,gjrtmbi,gjrv3k7,IMO Casual gamers typically stick to console. Once you start down PC gaming you realize how quickly hardware needs to upgrade and it almost becomes a hobby to build or mod a PC. The latency issues from streaming games is less about the PC hardware and more about internet bandwidth.
667,gjr9g5o,gjruipe,"Personally, I wouldn't count on trying to time a potential short squeeze. We have no idea how and when short sellers will attempt to exit their position and there may not be a sudden large spike in price with all shorters trying to exit at once. Instead, shorts could be unwound slowly over a substantial time period, during which time the stock would steadily rise. Even a substantial rise sometime in the next few days may not be a sign of a short squeeze and could be followed by further increases in price.

The VW squeeze that is commonly referenced was a special case with Porsche acquiring 74% of VW and per German regulations, a German state permanently held 20%. [1] As an alternative example, consider TSLA, which cost short sellers $38 billion in 2020, despite the stock not having a dramatic short squeeze spike. [2]

It's totally reasonable to sell once the stock exceeds some target price, but I think that should be based on your opinion of the long term value of the stock. There's no guarantee that you'll be able to buy back more shares latter at a lower price as would correspond to VW-like squeeze. Instead, the stock may just keep increasing.

So if you're looking at reputable charts (not robinhood) and trading is halted, don't send in an order. You'll get fucked by gay bears.

&gt;Q:   How will orders priced aggressively through a Price Band be handled by Nasdaq? (For example, price bands are $9.00/$11.00 and a bid is entered for $11.05)?

&gt;Orders that are priced aggressively outside the bands will be re-priced upon entry to the limit price bands (both IOC and longer time-in-force orders). Non-IOC orders that are slid due to LULD will receive a time-stamp upon being booked and will be treated according to standard price-time priority.‚Ä¢  For limit-priced orders entered via OUCH protocol. Incoming limit-priced orders shall reprice upon entry only once and subsequently will cancel resting limit-priced interest to buy (sell) if Price Bands move such that the price of the resting limit-priced interest to buy (sell) would be above (below) the upper (lower) Price Band.

&gt;‚Ä¢  For limit-priced orders entered via RASH or FIX protocols. Exchange systems shall reprice multiple times any limit priced interest to buy (sell) to the upper (lower) Price Band if Price Bands move such that the price of resting limit priced interest to buy (sell) would be above (below) the upper (lower) Price Band.

https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/MarketRegulation/LULD_FAQ.pdf

and for another easier to read source: 

&gt;The NBBO can be accessed if it is resting on the Price Bands.  However, if the stock is in a Straddle State, the bid or of f er outside t he price band is deemed non-executable.  *Therefore market  orders or aggressively priced limit  orders may be reject ed back t o t he sender or re-priced by exchanges once the price bands are reached.  There is currently no uniform practice by the stock exchanges on how market orders will be handled in a Straddle State.*  It is possible that bids and offers can fade fast er then the ref erence price is adjust ed.  However, the exchanges are st ill discussing how often  this  may  actually  occur  in  practice.  NASDAQ  conducted  two  studies  last  summer;  in  a  9  day  trading  period  N A SD A Q  examined  6100  Tier  2  stocks  and  not ed  t hat   t here  were  3800  instances  of   a  Straddle  St at e  t hat   averaged  12.5 minutes. Tier 1 stocks, in theory, should not see too many Straddle States.

\2. Putting in a sell order does not guarantee anything. The only way to guarantee it is to ask for a certificate for your shares which no one here is doing. There is a lot of conflicting info on this, but since they can't change your prices unless you placed a trade, even a limit order during a halt, you may as well. Better safe than sorry.  Squeeze until squoze.

Don‚Äôt get hung up on the specific price, the upper price band updates over a 5 minute window based on the average price + 10%"
815,l052ww,gjrji5l,Can we just do an instant order at the right time?
816,l052ww,gjrjgg4,This!  Don‚Äôt let the melvins spread misinformation.  You can set you limit sells where you want to take profit!  Aka $420.69!
817,l052ww,gjrjfmn,"Here‚Äôs an example of this rule.  You have a limit order to sell 1000 shares at 420.69.  Price spikes like crazy and there are numerous stops, for several days.  Price stops at 420, when they set the reference it‚Äôs above our price, in fact the lower band bottom is now 430, so your (now too low) limit sell order is moved up to 430.

LULD repricing can move sell orders up and buy orders down."

The bearish response is - they will need to find the personnel capable to assist Gen Z 12 year olds who know nothing and just want to get famous streaming fortnite. They will need to find more money to pay said capable employee - or or or perhaps have gaming pc templates  - - so you just need to know how the ""legos"" fit together. Mmmmm...

So far, all of their engineering job postings are for outdated and obsolete tech.  So far they're talking a good game, but haven't seen them put their money where their mouth is yet.

In my imagination, I can envision some amazing potential.  I've been building custom PCs since the early 2000s, and having a major retail store put focus on it would be amazing.  I don't have Microcenters or any other custom PC stores near me (Boston area), so it would be great to be able to see hardware components in person before making purchasing decisions.  And now that I've got a real career and real responsibilities, I don't have time to keep up with every little latest advancement for components, so I would be more than willing to pay a premium to get some input from a dedicated expert.

But it could also flop... *hard*.  This could end up being staffed entirely by teenagers that were rejected from Best Buy's Geek Squad, that are only able to answer your questions by looking at the product labels and hoping the answer is there.  The UI for the kiosks could easily end up being some clunky, hard-to-use disaster, instead of the sweet 3D-rendered product builder that some of us would be hoping for.  They could very easily also end up eschewing the latest-and-greatest of tech, in favor of whatever their vendors want them to push.

If done successfully, this could have GameStop leapfrog their way to the top of an entire retail vertical.  If done poorly, they are just hemorrhaging cash on yet another failed idea.  

Reminds me *a lot* of the hype they had a year or two ago for converting stores into these amazing retro-arcade type places, and re-defining what ""used games"" can mean.  They half-assed that, and the entire idea vaporized into the ether.  So far, from what I've seen, looks like they're half-assing this too."

Corsair is able to provide a full line-up of cases, memory, liquid cooling, fans, controllers, lighting, etc. that consumers can choose from, without getting everything all bungled up by picking-and-choosing from all sorts of different brands.  GameStop is already selling Corsair peripherals, so it's a natural progression to tap them as a core supplier for hardware components.

Should be interesting to see what suppliers they decide to work with for motherboards, GPUs, and monitors.  Guessing ASUS/RoG is going to have heavy involvement (*pure speculation*)."

Their business was already focusing heavily on pick-up orders.  They have put a ton of effort into making sure their mobile app works exceptionally well, and have spent years hyping up rewards programs to incentivize customers to use the app instead of strolling into the store and making orders in person.

Not only did they have that foresight for pick-up orders, they also were early adopters for working with 3rd-party delivery services such as GrubHub and Uber Eats.  While other restaurants fought against these in favor of their own in-house delivery, Chipotle welcomed them with open arms, and worked with them to provide a streamlined operational process.

Sit-down restaurants clearly took *massive* hits as they struggled to adapt to pick-up/delivery business models.  Fast food chains struggled to keep up with demand, as drive-thru lines started doubling or tripling in length, with consumer lashback.  But Chipotle was able to mostly operate as normal.

Especially now that they are rolling out their ""Chipotlane"" drive-thru pick-up windows for orders.  Adds more fuel to the fire."

Move all business online and use store space for pleasure and direct customer interaction; think apple genuis.

Sure you can buy drip there but the main purpose is product and customer interaction.

Fuck how about bringing back all the arcade demos but now you can spend a few bucks and spend hours trying out a new game. PC caffe but loaded pc's with steam , test games on different specs talk with techs about the right equipemt.

1150,gjt2vu8,gjvumx3,"35C = Strike price of $35.00. The amount of the call option itself depends on the expiration date and a whole bunch of other things,  this is called the premium. The actual dollar amount you pay for the call is whatever dollar amount is showing multiplied by 100.  So right now  1/19 @ 6:03pm EST,  the 35c with the Jan 22 expiration date is about $6.20 ($620.00). The price will go up the further out the expiration date is. Seriously, the Option subreddit has some great info (easy to read) on their wiki. All the other stuff that determines the option price is pretty important and you'll be happy with even an very basic understanding of Theta, Delta and IV, trust me!

1157,gjtft7e,gjua3pu,"It's bad for shareholders, which is why you should sell if you hear this news. It's good for Gamestop, because they can sell to shorts covering and investors hype about Gamestop, and use that money from that sale to pay off their debts. Now they've got a significantly reduced debt burden and potentially even more money to invest in omnichannel."
1158,gjskwy8,gju8zxz,Your exit price is whatever you'd be happy to walk away with.
1159,gjsja5y,gju8drn,How is everyone?
1160,gjtlwhr,gju4yj5,"With two deep ITM calls your exposure is basically the same as having 200 shares, but for a cheaper price. It's only worse if gme stays flat or goes down. Rolling into OTM options is your best bet if you think it's going triple digits. Basically your goal is to get as high a delta as possible for your set amount of money. 100 shares has 1 delta. If you roll into let's say 4 OTM contracts that are $500 each, your delta will be lower to start because they are OTM. But once they are ITM delta will get close to 1 each, giving you basically 400 delta whereas with shares you'd still be at 200. 

In any case, exercising them while there's still extrinsic (time) value on them is the worst move. Unless they're expiring soon it doesn't make sense."

1171,gjthn7d,gjtrmul,"Also at 130% short interest I don't think it would even matter. I also don't see the price dropping during the squeeze if the short interest remains high. 

Tho I'm kinda wondering. We are talking about the squeeze like it's gonna happen but for that we need the margin call to happen to fuck over the short sellers. When will this happen? I mean they must have potentially lost billions already. This seems like a fucking scam."

1190,gjtft7e,gjthn7d,"Well in a short term way it wouldn't be great since everyone will get diluted a tiny amount and it will help the shorts exit. But it would be a good thing for GME, they can do a lot with 100M. 

A $100m offering isn't even that huge now that we're at 2.5b anyways, only a 4% hit. It was much scarier at earnings when we were at 900m market cap, it would have been over a 10% dilution.

If GME times it right they might be able to do the 100m offering and only have to do a 1% dilution or less. Gme might as well take advantage of the squeeze while they can too. They'd be dumb not to if the price is right"

It's the console gamer with little knowledge being up sold to PC, which makes sense for the direction they sound to be designing stores as a more community focused experience with tailored products.

Take fortnite Timmy and say that your local gamestop will give him high speed rgb ram and matching strips for his top of the line PC with it all set up and good to go with an open offer to come back whenever. Help him go from being a generation $3-400 console buyer every 5 years to dropping 2-3k on rig/peripherals every other year or 3

Nevermind the deals and kickbacks from brands they can leverage with such a scale."

Imagine GME said they were going to hold 10,000 3070\80s for Club members and they get a half price instalation and warranty for $80 or whatever price on top of the subscriptions.

Scalpers are cut out by the installation offer and you can guarantee a huge customer satisfaction being able to access a level of such in demand product with premium service.

Even if it sells out instantly having such a method can be such an amazing retail and customer experience opportunity that no pure online retailer can offer.

1361,l0bxty,gjvonc9,"As a Funko Pop Collector (300+ pieces valued over $7K) I can tell yall that GameStop's Funko Market is not insignificant. Considering that GameStop frequently has items across the Funko brand that are exclusive to GameStop, they are essentially guaranteed to sell their entire stock in seconds if the Pop, or what have you, is in the right family. The online release of Star Wars Revan was sold out in seconds as robots bought them out to be upsold on the aftermarket. Now the little fucker can't be had for less than $40. With the upcoming release of so many SW projects, you can bet Disney is going to be trying to make up their losses from the army of Rose Ticos still haunting some shelves.

Pop collectors are completionists and even worse at managing money than your average cheese-brained RH user. They gobble up the exact same figures they already have because the new ones have a chrome finish. They all bitch and moan but buy them anyway! Funko has a monopoly on something like a $700M annual industry and GameStop has a regular slice of that pie all to itself with exclusives. Plus if you want a little more grease on that green dildo, Funko reported a 150% increase in e-commerce sales in Q320. Now that was direct to consumer, but no one actually buys from Funko because, again, robots. Funko does their best with queues and purchase limits but it is almost always a dog's dinner. So the average collector will make online purchases at a variety of retailers including our pals at GameStop who have a pretty regular deal of Buy 3 get 1 free. Point being though that Funko purchases, like everything else, are happening more and more online. I'd love to know what portion of GameStop's e-commerce increase was Pops.

The Funko market is only going to get bigger as more collectors enter the market. And Funko will never run out of ideas. Not as long as they keep making tv shows, movies, and other media. Hell they just released Back to the Future and Die Hard Pops! Funko doesn't sell collectible figures. They sell the emotion you associate with Luke Skywalker, Peter Venkman, or Goku packaged in vinyl and shaped into the exaggerated cranial features that human beings are biologically predisposed to liking.  


TLDR: MFer's are buying vinyl at GME.  üöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄ

1374,gjtp56e,gju3929,The cards stuff I just ignored because you can buy that stuff from lots of other places. If warhammer can‚Äôt keep stores going off that model GameStop definitely won‚Äôt be able to. Your 100% right the stores are dead weight and need to be dropped ASAP.
1375,gjtylq3,gju2qon,"Yeah I agree long term. The gaming industry is moving towards a fully digital delivery for games and there's no denying it. Granted it's taking longer than many predicted in the past, but there's no doubt physical disks will be a thing of the past.

It's a world I can't honestly see GME surviving in. I see people comparing Chewy to GameStop, but the flaw in that analogy is that Chewy offer a product that can only be physically delivered. You can't download pet food and supplies digitally. So it's much more realistic for Chewy to take on Amazon and win, which they did.

But the theory that GameStop will move to e-commerce is flawed from the start - the games industry is moving away from physical e-commerce. GameStop can't create an online digital delivery platform for console, it's a non-starter since Sony and Microsoft have their own stores.

If they did one for PC gamers I can't see it taking off either. It's already a massively overcrowded marketplace with almost every game developer from Rockstar to Epic having their own store (not to mention Steam). And in addition to this it costs a fortune to build the tech to actually deliver the games in the way gamers expect. GOG is a popular platform these days but CDPR only started making a very small profit from it in the last few years, it basically burned through money building the infrastructure to deliver the games digitally.

So nice short/medium term gains due to the squeeze? Hell yeah, count me in. For long term survival of GameStop? I don't buy it. I think a lot of investors/traders don't know anything about the games industry, and don't know how gamers think. The customer habits and sentiment has been massively overlooked in much of the DD for GME."

1383,gjtj3zv,gjtpk2f,Why do people keep recommending this. VR takes up huge amounts of space and all the games are sold digitally. There is no upside to this.
1384,gjtbvso,gjtpcdw,"They also need to stock secondary market cards if they are going to host tournaments. If I can't buy, sell, trade, pre or post tournament then you have no advantage over the local card shop."
1385,gjsy847,gjtp56e,"Your exactly right, imagine the wasted space for PC building centers then look at every GME in a city, thats a ton of space lost for a tiny store that is going to sell a handful of systems a month at very low margins. If we hit another videocard shortage, of which we are in the midst of, its game over for those stations for months. 

They need to shed these stores and go digital, the stores are an anchor around their neck. People talking about Pok√©mon and MtG cards clearly have no idea about the secondary market on these things. Take your average GME and now implement the ideas pitched:

Space for VR trials, there is a chunk of wasted space for an industry that never took off and is passed its hype phase.

Space for gaming tournaments, chairs, tables, monitors, consoles, etc.

Space for PC building centers.

Space for card players, MtG, Pok√©mon, etc.

Then try to fit it in most GME stores ... it's not realistic. Also you need to license every game played in the tournaments, you can't just pop in copies and play when you are a major entity like GME.

Cohen needs to shutter the stores and go digital."

In game theory, the stag hunt or sometimes referred to as the assurance game or trust dilemma describes a conflict between safety and social cooperation. Stag hunt was a story that became a game told by philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his Discourse on Inequality. Rousseau describes a situation in which two individuals go out on a hunt. Each can individually choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.

1529,gjsri0b,gjt3axs,"You are right, this situation is more like the [Stag Hunt Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt) than prisoner's dilemma. If it truly was a prisoner's dilemma situation then each individual would always profit more by having paper hands, but in a stag hunt your most profitable action is the same as everyone else. If everyone has paper hands then you should also have paper hands since the stock isn't gonna moon, but if everyone has diamond hands you are better off also having diamond hands.

Basically the prisoner's dilemma only has one nash equilibrium, everyone has paper hands. But the Stag Hunt Game has two, either everyone has paper hands OR everyone has diamond hands.

Yes some shares are naked so there might be slightly more than that 69.75m but being generous it should be no more that 4m per day. I would also assume institutions get better rates on borrowing shares than retail does. Also most shorts would have borrowed shares when the price was much lower than its current 35$ so their borrowing even less money than the current share value."

You don't want to set limit orders during live trading, but if you have already set the orders prior to halted trading, you will be fine. 

If you trying to set a limit order during halted trading, there is a chance it will slide to the price band closest meeting the criteria.

In fact, either broker could have taken the actual share out of a client's account who is on margin (who also supposedly owns it, but really has unknowingly lent it to their broker, who is responsible for covering it). Shorting is weird, and this exact sort of situation is why short squeezes get crazy, cuz each person in that chain has to return the share they've borrowed."

And who microwaves their tendies? Cook them in the oven you heathen, sacrificing flavor for short term gain smh."
1965,gjwgtn5,gjwzk5l,"Yes, wait. They want to let it build up before the stream and then crash the share price during/shortly after. If you time your entry for when it is falling, the price will rebound and they will be mega-fucked. I have my fingers crossed that RC will tweet right after the stream and the rabid degens of this sub will bid it up to the stratosphere. I've got $5k ready for that moment too. Open buy orders at $36. It seems like a lot of people are doing that and it might be a good support level. Time will tell."

1982,gjwnpwd,gjwozpd,"Don't have to be since the goal here is to kill shorters and make all of us good money/rich, even if it's just 10 shares. That is why the share target for the sub was 100 shares, 100*1000 would let people live less stressfully for a good year if the squeeze is successful. That's why closing margin positions and buying shares instead is so important."
1983,gjw6aer,gjwoufi,Huge short position at $21
1984,gjw6aer,gjwoqz6,"That‚Äôs hilarious because they have opened a previous short at $20, so by giving a PT of $20, they are already admitting defeat"

2028,l0ssqv,gjw7ahi,"When there are no more shares to borrow for shorting or the repo rate to borrow is too high all pros go to Delta-1 teams (desks, or option+stock combos). Delta-1 play consists of a synthetic short, and is done through multi-leg order (Buy Put, Sell Call, Buy Stock). Notice the buy and NOT the sell stock leg of the order, yet it's actually a short, research option-stock parity for details. Everyone talking about short squeeze and all this other shite seems to forget about what people with big bucks do."
2029,gjveo08,gjw77q1,"The potential catalyst of reinstating dividend is likely off the table with Cohen, as he wants this to be a growth/tech company. That would have been a big catalyst, but there are others, fully implementing PC builder kiosks, acquisitions, more partnerships and deals with Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo, e-trade-ins, e-sports. Once these begin showing significant earnings increases the boomers will start to wake up."
2030,gjve1zp,gjw6tfe,"It might be like Tesla, a long squeeze, as a result of their shitty scheming, a year of strong days.  Maybe this is better for Cohen's turnaround efforts so the mainstream has time to get on board, instead of thinking it's some pump and dump.  I'm not selling either way."

2032,l0ssqv,gjw6aer,"If the shorts had already adequately covered, Citron would have no reason to do this hit piece.  I think they went short around $20 when there was already a bunch of shitheads spouting that GME was way overpriced based on *past earnings statements*.  The market don't care about that shit.  A stock isn't a good short candidate if a) it's already shorted to hell, b) it's already trading at a sizeable discount to future cash flows, and big bad c) just because it's increased in price.

Shorts who came in at $20 made a huge and classic mistake thinking a stock that has appreciated 500% in 6 or 8 months *has* to go back down.

I think Citron established a short that is already significantly underwater, and they're desperate to push this back down to cover at a smaller loss.

The Tweet wording is extremely telling.  They're trying to scare everyone that GME is an enormous gamble and will fall right back to $20 in days.  Not likely to happen, and Citron is desperate to get out before Wall St. starts seeing a real plan from GME that has analysts seeing dollar signs.  If that happens soon, these guys are really fucked."

2204,gjvwce1,gjx0isy,"It all depends on people if their panic or not. With Palantir they managed to crash it from 33 to 25 I think. They also had way more shares for shorting than with gme.

With gme the bluff is so obvious I dont think they will be able to crash it that much. I would not expect to see it below 35, as yesterday closed close to 40. But one thing is sure, they already have an strategy in place.

Timing the exact bottom is complicates so I will be buying happily in the $35-38 range.

I think if they manage to make it crash below $35 there is a high likehood that Cohen or his crew step in. Cohen is right now 400% up so he can afford to put a few more bucks."

2217,gjvzjh9,gjw0p3a,Fair enough
2218,l0uof5,gjvzkh9,"I don't know technical analysis and am hardly a data dude. But I remember back in the day when BBY was going down hill back in 2011.

In 2012, Hubert Joly a Hospitality Executive was brought in. Everyone said BBY had too many brick and mortar and they could not compete with online retailers and the Amazons of the world. Joly made strategic partnerships, turned parts of their store into vendor showcase spaces, matched online pricing, and transformed the online ecommerce platform.

By all accounts by analysts and investors, BBY should have been done but they are more successful than ever. RC will have the same vision and will identify how to leverage GMEs differentiators, identify higher nargin service and product lines and digitally transform the organization and make them much more operationally efficient."

2220,gjvpkm8,gjvy8tk,Gamestop has a deal to get a percentage of Xbox and MSFT's digital distribution. So every game that gets sold directly on an Xbox benefits GME.

2225,gjvqnwq,gjvrujd,"They did, and I think that‚Äôs going to be the mechanism to pull console gamers into pc gaming. Late in a console cycle, budget gaming PCs of equivalent or greater power become available for roughly console prices. I think ~3-4 years from now when the next cycle is still a few years out, console gamers will be itching for the next thing, and GameStop/Microsoft will be the gateway drug with build-a-pc providing the outlet. It‚Äôs also a piece of that 60bn console market, so reliable revenue, and a great relationship with a cloud platform (azure)"
2226,gjvpk5b,gjvqnwq,Didn't they sign a deal with Microsoft for a percentage of online sales? Anyone have the details?
2227,l0uof5,gjvqkbc,"Also, the people shorting it have amazing confirmation bias. The bears I've seen on social media talk about insider selling, shop closures and B&amp;M as a case for their bear thesis. All the information is there for them but they lack insight."

2232,l0uof5,gjvpljz,What the fuck are you talking about lmfao
2233,l0uof5,gjvpkm8,"Not a üåà üêª but I think the more it nice to e-commerce, the shift from brick and mortar will be more towards people just buying straight from their console, not necessarily ecom stores. Every game can be bought from the console so I don't really know why anyone would buy games online at GameStop. Consoles will be pretty much the only thing needed to buy online. From my retarded point of view"
2234,l0uof5,gjvpk5b,"I‚Äôm with you on the overall conclusion (way undervalued) but how did you get that GameStop is half the video game space? Once they go ecom they‚Äôre competing with steam, egs, and console online stores. Plus gaming includes mobile, which is huge and something GameStop won‚Äôt touch.

EDIT: pc game revenue was ~6 billion of which steam is like 80% EGS is like 10% and the rest is shared

Console games are ~60 billion.

The thing that might do it actually is the build-a-pc kiosks. If GameStop can do something where they‚Äôll sell pc titles at half price or something like that to build-a-pc customers, they may be able to take console gamers back and sequester them from steam and other online retailers. There‚Äôs a huge amount of potential there, and I trust RC to do something with it. There‚Äôs a reason he put build-a-pc front and center boys. I think GME is going to revive pcmasterrace long term.

2253,l0v1wb,gjw1qst,"TL;DR: Boomers lack the understanding of the industry and target market, and fail to realize the massive gaping hole that exists for a one-stop-shop for everything gaming. The guy who realized this gap in another industry -  pet supplies - probably realizes it in this one.

I think GME, **IF RUN PROPERLY**, will be a *massive* company. I bought a fuckload of EA stock back when it was at around $20 because I loved Madden, saw how much they fucked over franchise for Ultimate Team, and realized they have to be making assloads of money on microtransactions to just throw away their decades-long loyal fans. Turns out it's a multi-billion dollar ""innovation."" Boomers saw a video game company and thought it was for greasy nerds. I, and many other young ~~investors~~ gamblers saw a giant (and scummy) money factory. I bought at $20. EA is now at $140.

2329,gjx6xro,gk5e335,"I don't think you're considering the advantage of bricks and mortar locations that GME can capitalize on for a pivot to ecommerce: 

In-store pickup. Faster than Prime and easier for trade-ins. GME has over 4,000 locations. There's a gamespot for every Bestbuy, Walmart and Target in any given city. 

Their favorable position for trade-ins is also a huge factor for driving disc sales. That also means that GME, in keeping all those stores stocked, has an insane amount of experience and infrastructure already in place for ecommerce logistics. 


The entire business can shift focus easily and with minor adjustments. The pivot doesn't require them to become the gamer version of Amazon and they can eschew the need for fulfillment centers while minimizing shipping costs by leveraging the number and spread of their locations."

Gamers are the whiniest consumers out there but they never talk with their wallets. If any non-game company ran their business like EA does they would've folded ages ago. 

There probably is no ceiling to the amount of corporate abuse gamers will take. Even the most virulently racist misogynistic right wing gamer screeching about ""muh degeneracy"" buys Cyberpunk 2077.

So Gamestop could have the advantage of being the first to do this. And with their membership card/program, if you get credits you don't just trade in for other digital games but you can use it on everything else they sell. It'd be brilliant as every digital sale increases return visits and more sales. None of the other digital stores can do this on their own.

Also consider Microsoft recently being very smart and targeting PC gaming more, even linking their Xbox/PC stores. What if MS has already seen the opportunity in reselling digital games like software licenses? What if their digital sales revenue deal with Gamestop is just phase one?

If you buy a $270 printer, the ink lasts forever and refills cost practically nothing. How many people do you know that own $270 printers?"
2368,gjwint2,gjzf52p,"I'm not Ryan Cohen of course but my take: 

1.  Shift away from dying physical sales to being an enthusiast hardware store and e-commerce brand with exceptional customer service.  

The customer service part is huge.  Somebody mentioned ""why go to Gamestop when I can just go to big box like BestBuy for gaming were there are other things to browse?"". 

IMO there are tons of people who think the exact opposite.  If I was shopping for a specific ""enthusiast"" type of item and I had a choice between a huge big box store wading through 90% BS that I don't care about, with associates who don't know squat and meh customer service vs an intimate enthusiast store with great customer service I'm going to the intimate store every time.  

Again it's one of the reasons PC people like Microcenters so much.  If you have a Microcenter you don't go to Best Buy.  Well Microcenters are limited, only 25 of them exist.  Imagine if Gamestop's became mini-Microcenters with even better customer service?     

2.  Tie a bunch of exclusives and perks under a membership model that encompasses both the physical shopping experience and e-commerce.  

     Imagine hardware/software packages and upgrade plans.  Buy a Gamestop upgrade subscription plan and with your Gamestop motherboard (just a simple partner deal) Gamestop will allow you to trade out your CPU/GPU every x-number of months/years for a discount.  Maybe even the store associate will install it for free for members?  Who knows.  Lots of options there.  

Buy an item online for quick store pickup?  Maybe members can have their parts tested on the spot so if there is an issue it can be addressed immediately with the great customer service.  Gamers know all the BS with buying PC gaming parts online.  With all the different components it's very common to get at least one defective part that sidelines your whole experience.  You then have to deal with shipping back/etc.  Imagine being able to get it handled same day in person at an intimate store with great customer service?  


Again I think the customer service aspect is HUGE.  You get people hooked with amazing customer service that is linked together for both hardware and e-commerce and you can pull people away from Big Box storms and other online gaming stores with ease IMO.  

And honestly you don't even have to pull many of them away do you?  The market is so damn huge.  You don't have to beat the likes of Steam, Microsoft, Sony, etc app stores.  Gamestop's membership plan could allow for cross platform deals.  I mean Gamestop already sells giftcards for streaming services like Steam, etc.  If you're a Gamestop member maybe you get a discount when you buy your digital giftcard for your Steam purchase?  

Imagine a e-commerce site with digital gift cards for all the big digital game stores that members get at a discount.  Could you buy the game straight through Steam for $30?  Sure.  Or with your Gamestop Gold Powerpass that same game is $25 via digital giftcard. 

And on the same website you have you GPU and CPU upgrades that you can go pickup from your local Gamestop same day or next day because you live in a smaller city that doesn't have a Microcenter.  And you like going to Gamestop's now because they have great customer service and if something in your build isn't right you can get it addressed right there.  


Of course I'm just a retard but again, you kill it with customer service with an entire eco-system of both hardware and software and then Gamestop will in fact have something that doesn't really exist right now."

I feel like a lot of people that believe in this genuinely understand business and how GME could create a valuable new business proposition, they just don‚Äôt understand the industry and how influential Microsoft is. They own like half the fucking studios for god sake, and nothing prevents them from making it a Xbox store exclusive, or providing further discounts over anyone else because they own the games themselves in a lot of cases. Microsoft is so far entrenched in their market there is not a god damn chance anyone makes a subscription model that could beat theirs because they could always undercut them since they‚Äôre so widely integrated. 

They own the hardware, the own the integrated online marketplace that is steadily becoming the sole marketplace as their consoles go entirely digital. They own the major game studios like Bethesda ect. They also already have a subscription service that gives you the latest and greatest consoles when they release as part of the plan too, and through bundling the console to the subscription they can afford to sell it at an initial loss while GameStop can‚Äôt."

2376,gjxdla6,gjz8a0e,"This This This.

I have a 15 year old nephew and a 12 year old nephew - one in S. IL and the other in SC. Completely different upbringings. Both played console games - the 15 year old CoD and the 12 year old Fortnite. Both now want to build PCs."
2377,gjx5j7s,gjz87gs,"The subscription model would be in partnership with the console manufacturers themselves. Microsoft already gives a commission for every gamepass customer gme signs up.

You're also way too focused in on physical games. If GME focuses on physical games were all going broke, obviously.

None of what you're suggesting is news. New directors wouldn't jump in to focus on selling physical games."
2378,l0yzb5,gjz7vbw,"So what you‚Äôre saying is, once the squeeze is over, take some of the profits from the meme account and put them in the retirement account to buy and hold GME long term."
2379,gjz30op,gjz6ami,"Ah that makes sense, thanks for explaining. I'm with you that it is moronic, seems like desperate doubling down as others have suggested. I think you are right about it being a longer squeeze. It would have been incredible if it happened all at once but they know all kinds of tricks and loopholes to avoid that from happening."
2380,gjxbvyn,gjz5x6w,"You can say that about any company that sells a competing product. 

Why does target still exist when there‚Äôs an Amazon? Or why does Chewy? It‚Äôs about getting customers into the brands eco system and up selling them. The retailer becomes top of mind to the consumer because of brand, service, product offering, and price. I believe what Ryan Cohen has seen is the powerful brand behind the name GameStop. Once a customer purchases something, it‚Äôs much cheaper to retain and encourage them to buy something again than to acquire new customers."
2381,gjz5lhq,gjz5qy4,"No, for sure, I fully agree with that."
2382,gjz56v8,gjz5lhq,"Right I‚Äôm just saying there shouldn‚Äôt be any issues with case size at this point.  The market is well developed and there are a wide variety of options to accommodate just about anything, so the concern over it in the above comment was not warranted imo.  That‚Äôs all.  The mini-ITX watercooling is just an example of how much can actually be crammed into the smallest of cases, so any store employee building something for a parent should have no problem finding a case to accommodate whatever spec the parent wants to go with regardless of where they plan on putting it.  Make sense?"
2383,gjypgss,gjz56v8,"It‚Äôs fun for you or me, a bunch of PC enthusiasts. But I‚Äôve put together PCs for family and friends who would have loved to have a boutique store put together the PC for them. It‚Äôs like how some people love to repair their own cars, but I‚Äôll gladly pay others to do car work for me despite how easy some car work is."
2384,gjz2qlq,gjz30op,I don‚Äôt.  I think the shorts are still completely screwed.  I think it‚Äôll be a longer squeeze similar to what happened to Tesla not a short spike but there‚Äôs no question shorting the stock at this valuation is moronic
2385,gjy1dno,gjz2qlq,[deleted]
2386,gjytz00,gjyulhf,"You're assuming they will have a choice.

And I wouldn't be so sure, anecdotal only but of myself and 5 other friends who bought ps5s we all went for the disk version, intentionally rather than forced.

100$ is really not a lot of money, I easily saved double probably triple that through the life of my PS4 by buying and selling tradeins."
2387,gjytfxp,gjytz00,"I know that PS5 demand vastly outstrips supply, which is the detail that matters. 

When that's the case, telling me which version of the console sold more says nothing about consumer demand.   
However, if consumer trends from the last 30 years hold up, most people will not want to spend **$100 more** for a feature that won't make their gaming experience any better."
2388,gjxznbq,gjythsx,"What? If I was a still a kid I'd **much** prefer the ability to instantly buy a new game from home, rather than trying to cajole my parents to drive me to the store. 

Are you insane?"
2389,gjyt63f,gjytfxp,"They did create more disk versions, still the case though.

I like the way you have super strong opinions on this stuff and literally have no idea about any of the details."
2390,gjycwdf,gjyt63f,"....There's literally a PS5 shortage. People who want one can't even get one. 

So if we assume your 3:1 ratio is true, the only way that the disk version would be outselling the digital version would be if Sony created/distributed more disk versions. It's ***not*** a reflection of consumer demand.

....assuming your ratio is true."
2391,gjyrpv2,gjys1ur,A fair number of people (you included) have pushed back and given good feedback which I appreciate.  I‚Äôm not looking for an echo chamber or to pump and dump- just to share how I looked at it.  Some people have recommended looking hard at ebitda which I‚Äôll do btw.   So it‚Äôs been a good thread overall.  There will always be people who don‚Äôt really read and discuss but that‚Äôs WSB I can‚Äôt control that
2392,gjyrm29,gjyrt9q,They do and they aren‚Äôt providing real value to your point.  This is why I think there‚Äôs a huge turnaround opportunity.  If it continued as is I would say long term this company goes to zero
2393,gjyr0f8,gjyrpv2,"My point is: no one is asking the difficult questions, it is being accepted at face value. A pitch isn't a set of facts, it's a narrative about the future that needs huge scrutiny the more unknowns that are involved."
2394,l0yzb5,gjyrm29,Correct me if I am wrong but don‚Äôt they already have a subscription model that gives discounts on games? Isn‚Äôt the issue that a myriad of other retailers are giving even better discounts without a membership? The GameStop name is synonymous with ‚Äòoverpriced‚Äô and it‚Äôs lost a lot of good will. Perhaps it can regain it but I would wait and see.
2395,gjymmxz,gjyr8ej,My personal take is that everyone focuses in on selling games which is a small piece of the potential- it‚Äôs the whole ecosystem around gaming that to me has yet to be unlocked. Let‚Äôs wait and see what Ryan Cohens plan is but his track record is on providing the best experience focused on the customer so I think if anyone can put a vision together and execute he can.
2396,gjym6mg,gjyr0f8,I put it out there for feedback? The feedback is helpful and useful to see what other people are looking at.  That‚Äôs the point of a pitch.
2397,gjx8aw4,gjypgss,"Cramming a full custom watercooling loop, full length GPU, radiators, etc into a Mini ITX Build 12L case was part of the fun (and challenge) for me when I built mine.  

That being said I think the majority of these ‚Äúparents buying their kids a rig‚Äù builds would be well served with something like a micro ATX mini tower build.  Nobody is doing SLI dual 3090s for their first entry level build.  Shouldn‚Äôt be much issue with case size, regardless of components, if you‚Äôre just doing a single GPU build."

2399,l0yzb5,gjymmxz,"As an interesting of a WSB autist and gamer myself, why do we believe that there is so much growth when competing with non-subsrriotion based platforms like Steam?

Don't get me wrong, I'm holding GME, but mostly because of the short, not because I think there is an ""untapped market"" for selling games. Again, steam/valve offers me an online platform to purchase a game at the click of a button."

2418,gjxwa1g,gjxwfg0,I would personally take some profits at 5-10x then increase my positions when it goes back down. I‚Äôm at 575 shares with $5k on the side to be averaged in.
2419,gjxjfux,gjxwa1g,Precisely this. I got in purely to make the most of the console cycle and then dip out soon after the Q4 earnings. However Ryan Big Dick Cohen then stepped in and quickly changed my perspective all together. The short squeeze as you say would just be an added bonus for a short term gain. I‚Äôm currently sat on circa 700 shares with an average price of $14 (400 standard shares and the remainder in a CFD position) and in a bit of a predicament as to how to play this. IF the short squeeze was to happen and the stock pops off at searing pace do I take those short term gains &amp; then get back in when it settles back down again and then hold for the long run as a value play? Or B do I just hold everything for the long run now? For me personally I‚Äôm leaning towards option A.

It's honestly extremely depressing shit and it implies there was illegal naked shorting at play by the hedge funds (Burry basically confirmed this with hit tweet yesterday - called back his borrowed shares in May and it took weeks). They have been corned for months now (SEC is also culpable for non-enforcement).  The actual exposure for the brokerages, banks, clearing houses etc could completely wipe away their market caps (would immediately need Government bailouts)"

2633,gjx7ojo,gjx91rj,Thanks for all these great explanations. So the sell off we saw shortly after open today. The one that was coordinated with the Citron tweet. Are we thinking basically all of those were synthetic shares?

2635,gjx68tb,gjx8mj2,I just did some reading about this and apparently with naked shorting the IOU created by the short seller is treated just like a normal share. So basically the shorts can just print and sell more and more synthetic shares to drive the price down and try to shake people out. This will keep happening until someone (i.e. broker) forces them to buy back the synthetic shares. This is how you can end up with more than 100% ‚Äúshares‚Äù
2636,l11ww7,gjx8jjw,"This post fuck me. That video was insane.
If all this actually plays out the way you say... imma be out of debt and finally opening my own business my wife and I been dreaming off.

Very eye opening.
Fucking diamond hands motherfuckers. If wsb can actually fight the hedgefunds and succeed its history in the making.

Well goodspeed brothers, lets go to fucking outer space!"
2637,l11ww7,gjx7ssb,"So I keep hearing that shorts are having to pay all this money from short interest. There was even one post where a guy did math and found that shorts can't make any money at all by the 44th day if GME stays at around $40


Is this true? Is it possible that these shorts will never find a way to sell their shorts? If GME's price remains the same or goes up, aren't they losing money no matter what and also increasing the stock price?"
2638,gjx53hn,gjx7ojo,"It's starts to get really technical, but its not the MM's (they run delta neutral books and there is a option maker exception for naked short selling).  It would be the prime brokerages that would be borrowing shares behind the scenes.  The could also be switching cash accounts to margin accounts to borrow more securities etc. When securities are bought and sold but don't actually settle, it's a failure to deliver. 

The shares and synthetic shares (IOUs) can all be traded and there is no real difference. It's like counterfeiting money to an extent except it creates a legal obligation.  The shorts want a company to go bankrupt so they don't need to rebuy the shares at all.  It also can put some context on why they didn't exit at $4 to begin with  - they might not actaully all that greedy and just didn't want to expose that they had a ton of naked shorts outstanding to drive the price to that level (illegal) 

In a short squeeze the entire web of lies will unravel (share recall would also do the exact same thing).  If there are 140 million shareholders and only 69 million legitimate shares outstanding, it's a massive game of musical chairs if there isn't float to closes off the short postiond by rebuying the shares (72 million people need to sell and the shorts need to buy all those shares)"
2639,gjx53hn,gjx68tb,No the broker actually loans the shares from your account. They no longer have them. But you are owed a share in the future. If shares were recalled to say elect RC as chairman and CEO shorts could be forced to cover by brokerages
2640,gjx16zn,gjx53hn,OK I‚Äôm a bit confused by the process. MMs are swapping out shareholder‚Äôs shares with IOUs and the shorts sell the real ones on the market. But naked shorting means the real share ‚Äúhas not been verified to exist‚Äù so what are they actually selling? You can‚Äôt sell these IOUs as actual shares right?
2641,gjx16zn,gjx4o1f,"Okay, but what is a synthetic share? /s"
2642,gjx2n9z,gjx41fr,"Enough people follow Citron and their negative hit pieces can drop markets enough that people can and will trade on it.  They are paid shills at best and their last good play was going long amazon because of COVID.

Their playbook is issuing a  short thesis for an absurd price level only to go long with a better entry price well before it happens."
2643,gjx0p5q,gjx2n9z,"Any insight on the huge dump after the Citron tweet? Everyone‚Äôs been blaming citron for dumping share into the market, but the uptick rule was in effect today. Had to be actual longs that were scared and paper handed it, right?"
2644,gjx1cy8,gjx28kw,"It would immedietaly restore price discover and make Gamestop and Ryan Cohen a household name.  It will be on the news for days about how a bunch of retards all became millionaires.

A big reason for these posts is to document the correct narrative.  If the general investor realizes how corrupt the markets are do you  think they will continue to invest more money? Will they retain their existing holdings or pull out of the market?  There could be alot of fallout as a result and I don't want WSB to get blamed for calling out manipulation by the 1% (they were the ones that got greedy by not closing their shorts at $4)"
2645,gjwyi2e,gjx1p57,They might just pull out tomorrow (conflicting event etc) . They already accomplished what they needed today and stopped a continued run up.  The share price could have gone parabolic either  today or last Wednesday.  Things are ready to burst and whatever Citron says will be complete garbage (purposely misleading the market is in itself manipulation)
2646,gjx0p5q,gjx1cy8,"There were people posting screenshots of the sell walls earlier but it‚Äôs hard to say if they are legit unless they are consistently shifting. Somebody needs to record it though like via screen recording or something. 

I agree it‚Äôs close to blowing up and I really wouldn‚Äôt want to be in the shorts position praying that RC or someone doesn‚Äôt tweet something bullish providing catalyst that can set this off. There has to be some cooperation amongst institutions here right? You would think one of them would be running to be the first one out the door. Why hasn‚Äôt that happened yet? 

Do you think a squeeze is good for GameStop as a company? Probably the best way they could play this is by doing the same thing that Porsche did with VW. A mountain of cash could fuel their pivot and pretty much eliminate the threat of bankruptcy for a very long time."
2647,gjwzd75,gjx16zn,"When  you short a share you create a new share.  The original shareholder who lent out the stock still owns it along with the new long position.  This is how you can have institutional ownership above 100% on this stock. 

If there is naked shorting (not first borrowing a share that can be shorted) this situation gets much worse for the shorts than most people realize right now."
2648,l11ww7,gjx0vl0,Nice
2649,gjwzooo,gjx0p5q,"Sell walls are incredible visable.  I typically have level 2 streams up vs charts and it's been noted by multiple posters.

Price discovery isn't happening right now.   The massive daily swings based on tweets with 'webinar tomorrow' shouldn't sink stocks 10%.  Things are getting close to a tipping point and this is  close to blowing up.

Cohen will want the squeeze to a) diffuse the short interest &amp; allow actual price discovery and  b) for all the free publicity for GME will receive (everyone will hear about this on the news for days)"
2650,gjwxpmv,gjx03ao,"Naked shorting is illegal (purpose of Regulation SHO). There are plenty of strategies that unfortunely allow hedge funds to skirt the rules and if they do get caught its only a slap on the wrist.  This just wasn't relevant to the post as it becomes much more technical and isn't visable to the market directly (it is super interesting/depressing stuff if you want to look into it) 

When hedge funds are basically playing all their cards and don't care if it's transparent or not to the market, they have their risk management groups breathing down their necks.  Short attacks are typically coordinated and involve multiple groups and they collectively all make a ton of money. If they lose on GME, there is a serious risk of them killing their historical gravy train (regulation).  The 1% doesn't like to lose but they are at serious risk of losing big here and I am just going to document it all as it progresses."
2651,l11ww7,gjwzooo,Short laddering and sell walls should be visible in the book so maybe we should get some of our local autists to monitor it and record.

2657,l11ww7,gjwxpmv,"Great post but it reinforces my overall view the ""price discovery"" is a joke and we're all playing cards with a rigged deck. Where the SEC won't enforce basic rules against market manipulation; isn't that actually their job? The SEC won't require the shorts to cover their positions? Then outlaw naked short selling. 

Selling naked shorts is illegal in Europe.[https://www.globalcustodian.com/naked-short-selling-banned-by-eu/](https://www.globalcustodian.com/naked-short-selling-banned-by-eu/)

We need to keep making complaints to the SEC as well. That the stock is being manipulated by Citron Research and the short sellers; that they're not having to cover their shorts and that we're losing money as a result of this illegal manipulation.

Maybe also we should start a movement to move our Congresscritters to pass a law the SEC can't ignore to make naked short selling illegal. I bet a lot of corporations who own these Congresscritters would get behind that as they are threatened by this activity also."

2771,l136l3,gjxcu68,This should have the shitpost flair. So much crap gets through just for being GME.
2772,gjx8zc9,gjxa3bo,"That's their annualized interested rate. It is accrued daily. Let's look at a hypothetical 50% borrowing rate.

If $365,000 of stock was borrowed and sold short. Then they'd accrue $500 of interest after the first day (1/365 *  0.50 * $365,000) if the stock doubled the next day, then now $1,000 additional interest is owed. This brings the total interest charges up. So you can see how they can't just maintain their positions and wait it out, the borrowing fee is huge. They'll bleed money if they try..

Anyway, what's unclear to me is if for each borrowed share the borrowing rate is constant for the life of the position, or if the borrowing rate is allowed to fluctuate. I'm guessing it's constant. Please chime in if you know the answer."

In terms of customer base, most customers were boomers who knew the brand. Most would either come in for a TV remote, antenna, or parts bin for loose electronics. While margins were high, volume did make the difference. 

People wanted TVs, computers, and iPods and RadioShack never had these items in store. We had to order it in custom fro the customer which made for a very hard sell back in 2003. 

GameStop focusing on expanding on PCs, shared revenue with OEMs, and leveraging their foot print compared to Amazon, Target, and Walmart will help them grow long term. 

Gaming is growing, more people played video games during the pandemic than ever!  As AR and VR continue to grow we will see people wanting the new technology and GameStop will be another store with dedicated staff to educate a person into their purchase. Go into Best Buy, Target, or Walmart and most folks have no idea what to buy."

2827,gjxbd72,gjxp3zj,"Imagine - you open up chrome on your pc. It's a little old, a bit out dated, and you think ""man I love google chrome but i really need more ram."" You open gamestop in a tab, select your local store and buy some ram. Doesn't really make sense to just get some ram shipped to you, so you place your order and drive down to pick it up, already paid for.  
Get home, install said ram and boom. Chrome runs perfectly again.  


What a time to be alive"

2830,gjxeo9f,gjxgpyj,"Absolutely nobody is pitching Gamestop as a build-a-bear. Gamestop in an ecommerce market could be the Best Buy dedicated to gaming. A retail infrastructure to acquire and service new clientele  and then an ecommerce platform to expand and build on that relationship.

PC gaming is just one example of where they have opportunity reaching the untapped market of buyers who aren't necessarily the users, or completely new users. There's absolutely nothing risky about selling retail shoppers on a line of prebuilts as their entry into pc gaming and then servicing them with more bespoke options online as they progress.  Prebuilts are hardly a risky move even, that's why there are like 15 companies dedicated to it thriving right now. Now imagine that market where you're not overwhelmingly relying on them deciding to game on pc, but one where you have the infrastructure to sell them on that too..."
2831,gjxc6jx,gjxga8s,"Ironically - it‚Äôs sometimes easier for a brick and mortar store to keep things in stock. 

You have a single agreement with the manufacturer (or distributor) at the back end, but each store just deals with its own foot traffic.

Even just putting one 3080 on the shelf in every GameStop is going to get far more cards into gamer‚Äôs hands than any online store that just wants the bots to empty their warehouse in 5 seconds.

Stores can then move stock around between stores if necessary.

It‚Äôs not as bad an idea as it sounds."
2832,gjxc6jx,gjxfxwr,"I'm sorry, but this is just wrong. You're mistaking a really short term demand (launch) for mattering more than long term demand. Gamestop gets a seat at the table when they decide to sell PCs because they have a direct line to every mom and and grandma out there looking to buy their kid a gift, one of the last untapped markets to actually build something in pc gaming.

Granny Smith isn't being sold on getting her kid a gaming pc by browsing Newegg, she's doing it after her mall walk when she's trying to find a gift for her grandkid. There is insane value in that with both hardware distribution and digital distribution as a partner. Anyone who doesn't think that Gamestops infrastructure doesn't get them a massive chip t bargain with is high.

Why do you think Gamestop dictates what they want to console manufacturers in the world of ecommerce and Amazon and usually gets it? Because they're the only entry to a certain, very profitable, class of customer that right now they sell exclusively on owning consoles. Anyone remember last gen when they devised that trade-in system that basically installed them as the only means to trade in a game to the detriment of consumers, publishers, and console manufacturers? The one that took the entire console gaming fandom banding together to stop? Now imagine that type of bargaining power in the hands of a board looking to service the customer rather than get serviced by the customer... They could do some cool things with a little imagination.

Okay, so it's not guaranteed to be the most earth shattering thing in the world, but it can be steady, good business. Their market cap right now is $2.7 billion. Chewy sells fucking dog toys on the back of a similar industry-specific retail powerhouse and has a market cap of $44 billion dollars. It doesn't take a genius to see where this industry-specific hybrid commerce strategy can make money. Even past the squeeze this stock could be undervalued if see where RC likely wants to take it, only this time he's doing it right at the retailer rather than selling a platform off to them for it to happen."
2833,gjxd7g4,gjxeo9f,"Except prebuilts has existed for decades now? And Dell invented the JIT customized PC component process. You‚Äôre imagining a world where a people will want to build a PC like going to Build-A-Bear but there is no way that is true. On top of that it isn‚Äôt even feasible. The components for a teddy bear are cheap and easy to store, but you would need an entire Fry‚Äôs Electronics to do the same thing for PCs. And oh yea, Fry‚Äôs have been closing stores left and right because people would rather buy their parts online than go to a physical store

GameStop‚Äôs physical retail side is FUBAR. Their only chance at salvation is online"

2842,gjxc5t4,gjxcblo,I actually am an autistic fuck who likes to build gaming systems for flight sims.  Right now the disconnect when you build a pc is you need to use user benchmark and pc part picker to put a  system together. If game stop rolls that experience into one outlet it would be great.
