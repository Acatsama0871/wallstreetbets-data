In this case, I have a feeling it would be the death blow to GME. Wait for the squeeze to start THEN issue the shares but after the hedge funds have throughly got pounded. That way the little guys win, and then fund

Today you, tomorrow me - what needs to be their mantra"
2,gkomm9f,glbygcz,"I have a feeling Gamestop is going to issue enough new shares to cover the shorts, and raise capital.  They have a whole weekend to figure out how to stop this squeeze, and that'll probably be the way to do it.  I fully expect them to issue a TON of new stock on Monday."

4,glbstgj,glbuaf6,"Great DD by the way.  I know how big of a pain it can be to get it all down.

While I got ya, what is your take on this End Game theory? 

Hmm yes. The S&amp;P 500 Index is an index of, roughly speaking, the 500 biggest U.S. public companies by market capitalization. GameStop is not in that index, because a month ago it was a small company, in the index of 2,000 small companies. Now it is—measured by market capitalization, though nothing else—a big company. If the redditors can hold on long enough, can they get GameStop added to the S&amp;P? Can they *turn it into* a big company just by bidding the stock up? If they can, then S&amp;P 500 index funds will be forced to buy it, no matter the price, and all the redditors who brought it here can get out at a profit. And they will have a big and permanent win, and also the current version of financial capitalism—the index-fund version—will collapse in absurdity.

9,l4hnrh,glb9mxw,Next earnings report looks like it would be early March.  1 Day after the next earnings call would be the timing for an insider sell off.
