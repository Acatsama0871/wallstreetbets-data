0,kzocqo,GME: What is actually happening this week?,13,"Yes, there were a lot of DDs on GME this past Friday/etc. However, a lot of them were bears disguised as bulls. Too much misinformation floating around.

One ever suggested buying shares on margin, and which broker was the best to do so.

I also read a more unbiased DD saying that GME will likely go red next week as the shorts continue to double down for a last-ditch effort. And that the following week will be deep green.

So what's actually happening?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzocqo/gme_what_is_actually_happening_this_week/,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52
1,kzotqk,How market makers consistently win selling weekly options - GME,46,"GME long share holder here and buying more next week as well :) I notice many on WSB are over buying OTM weekly calls and I want to explain why retail investors consistently lose on this.

1) As of last friday's close, a GME $36 1/22/21 call costs $460 while an April $40 call costs $900. Let's assume the next huge GME up move happens one random week between now and April 16th. It will cost on average about $2750 buying one weekly call option every week to hit a big win while it only costs $900 to buy one April call. Buying a weekly call after a volatility spike makes you a 3:1 under dog right off the bat. 

2) Institutions own a lot of gamestop shares and market makers can manipulate implied volatility and price in the short term as they please to protect their delta neutral options portfolio. It's common knowledge that robinhood poors rarely exercise OTM weekly options and market makers take full advantage of this.

&amp;#x200B;

The first hour of open on GME on 1/13 the market maker's realized a surge of buyer's were entering and unusual buying volume was occurring (anyone have info on why btw? seemed kinda random to me). To adjust for this, they excessively increased implied volatility on the weekly options so the lagging FOMO buyers were paying a 3-4x+ premium for the same calls. Eventually implied volatility got so extended that people start selling. This allows the market maker selling the options to maintain delta neutral regardless of how many more people buy weekly options, because the next person to buy the call is paying a ridiculous premium compared to the previous buyers.

This being so, eventually the rate of theta decay will exceed the rate of incoming buyers, and the market maker wins.

TLDR: buy GME shares or April+ calls instead of weekly OTM calls!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzotqk/how_market_makers_consistently_win_selling_weekly/,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

6,kzphxt,GME DD: Fair value is at least $74/share. Conservative $2.3bn in e-commerce sales in 2022. OPEN FOR DD 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 [Warning: LOTS OF OC],223,"I’ll start by admitting I was originally going to post the below analysis to a certain **S**tock **A**nalysis website that will not be named. However, I decided to forgo the $42 in CPM revenue and instead take my talents to WSB since I’ve been having so much fun shitposting about GME with you guys the past month. I also think this might be the first Sum of the Parts (“SOTP”) analysis that has even been posted to WSB. 

Now I know most of you can hardly read, let alone understand revenue multiples. But if you stick with me, you’re in for a bullish treat. Long story short, if we apply **even the** **most conservative** forward revenue projections and EV/revenue multiple to GameStop’s e-commerce business, we arrive at a fair value per share of $74.05. Additionally, this fair value **DOES NOT** factor in the intrinsic value from a potential short squeeze that is an added ""cherry on top"" when you buy GME shares.

**SKIP TO THE BOTTOM FOR A TLDR** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

# Full analysis behind the $74/share fair value

When reading the many bearish articles that have carpet bombed  investment websites and now even WSB, one thing is apparent. The authors want to talk about ANYTHING BUT valuation. They would rather base their thesis on “BlOckBuSTer” instead of calmly and rationally analyzing forward revenue streams and applying a fair multiple based on public comparable companies.

I believe that is likely the reason we have not seen a “SOTP” (Sum of the Parts) analysis for GameStop yet for broad consumption. Not even the Wall Street analysts who are being paid piles to analyze this company are performing this analysis-- they would rather just double down on their $1.60 price target than do the work. Preforming a SOTP analysis on GameStop is critical because it is the only way to give the Company credit for the **significant** **e-commerce revenues** **it is achieving** and the rich multiple that e-commerce sales demand from the market. “*Multiple expansion is a hell of a drug*.” - Michael Burry

# Modeling revenue projections

Before we can value GameStop on a forward basis, we must reasonably arrive at a forward revenue assumption and the corresponding percentage breakdown between e-commerce and brick and mortar sales.

We can start with GME’s recently released 9-week holiday sales figures for the period ending January 2nd, 2021. By examining the delta between last year’s 9-week revenue figures and the subsequent full quarter figures, we can reasonably arrive at an assumption of $2.1bn of revenue for the fiscal quarter ending in February 2021. Management also publicly stated that 34% of holiday sales were e-commerce. For this analysis, we will apply that percentage to the full quarter estimate.

*Processing img cdy97vncf1c61...*

The next step is to build on the Q4 assumption to model out the next fiscal year through Q4’2022E (the fiscal quarter ending February 2022). Luckily, we have a great proxy to achieve this—we can utilize GameStop’s quarter-on-quarter revenue growth the 2013 console launch. We can also reasonably assume an expansion from 34% to 40% e-commerce sales over the next four quarters as Ryan Cohen executes his strategic vision. 

[Source: GME 10-Q filings, author assumptions](https://preview.redd.it/fax5gecjf1c61.jpg?width=1866&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b59f50aad048decbbc68450c68df3bef15c9640)

We can use the above quarterly figures to inform an annual projection model that will be the foundation of our SOTP analysis. 5% revenue growth is a conservative estimate based on actual figures from the 2013 console cycle and the uptick in demand for both new and used consoles and games that followed the launch of the new consoles.

[Source: GME 10-K filings, author assumptions](https://preview.redd.it/k26jmdinf1c61.jpg?width=1544&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c960121888b8bb0b60074bdeaac898a568e17202)

# Determining and applying an e-commerce revenue multiple based on peer comparables

Now that we have a reasonable estimate for both e-commerce and B&amp;M revenue for GameStop’s fiscal year ending February 1, 2023, we need to apply a multiple to both revenue streams to bridge to enterprise value. Upon review of a set of public internet retail peers, we find a median EV/CY2022E revenue multiple of 3.2x.   

[Source: Factset ](https://preview.redd.it/8c0i8pqrf1c61.jpg?width=997&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85d7ca0a194c580c6e540452a0e646e6eba77ecb)

For the purpose of my SOTP analysis, I will apply only a **2.0x revenue multiple to e-commerce sales, which is highly conservative.** It goes without saying that if Ryan Cohen were able to achieve a e-commerce revenue multiple equal to Chewy (the company he founded!) the long-term growth in GameStop’s share price would be enormous. Using this conservative e-commerce revenue multiple of 2.0x and applying a de minimis multiple of 0.2x to GameStop’s legacy brick and mortar business, **we arrive at a fair value per share of $74.05 on a SOTP basis.** 

 

*Processing img b4asaomuf1c61...*

For fun, if we drop Chewy’s e-commerce multiple into the above table, we get a fair value per share of $151.76. 

[Source: GME public filings, author assumptions ](https://preview.redd.it/u06o5uc0g1c61.jpg?width=855&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3fec1ebacbb84e7ed48a98406ec5be63acba828)

The upside to current implied by this analysis is significant, but based on the market’s reaction to Ryan Cohen’s activism so far, a 100%+ gain on a re-rating of projected e-commerce revenues doesn’t seem so far-fetched. Clearly the stock has made a run since its lows in April of last year, but the market still has not fully priced in GameStop’s present and future e-commerce revenues at a fair multiple relative to peers.  

*Processing img 1uuw4yf2g1c61...*

Everyone is tunnel visioning on if the short squeeze has squoze yet, and/or to what extent shorts have covered so far. But after doing their DD on a SOTP basis, GME holders can sleep well at night knowing that there is still 100%+ upside once GME’s e-commerce revs. are fairly valued by the market.

# TLDR

* GameStop's growing e-commerce revenues (**34% of holiday sales!**) deserve a far higher multiple than the company's legacy brick and mortar business.
* Comparable internet retail companies trade at median EV/CY'22E revenues of 3.2x. **Chewy trades at 4.4x EV CY’22E revenues**
* Even with the recent share price run, **GameStop still only trades at 0.4x 2022E revenues**, of which the revenues will likely be 40% e-commerce at a minimum.
* **SOTP valuation analysis indicates a fair value of $74.05 per share. At the same e-commerce revenue multiple as Chewy, GME’s fair value is $151.76 per share**

35,kzrxvu,Here's my quick (af) research on GME squeeze vs VW squeeze - projected to Valhalla?,44,"So, I've seen lots of high quality DD in the last 2 weeks, thank you, autists.  


One thing I've never seen (it may have been included in some peoples DD or comments on other posts but I have not come across it. This is what I found in comparison with the VW ""infinity squeeze"":  


&gt;Prior to October 2008, Porsche alone had already controlled 30% of VWs shares.  Next, the government fund of Lower Saxony (the home province of VW in Germany) owned an additional 20% of VW as a strategic stake.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition, various index funds owned around 5% of VW due to VWs large weighting in the DAX index.  These index funds were required to hold VW in proportion to its weight in the DAX, such that they would not be able to sell simply due to changes in the price of VW.  Volkswagen alone made up 17% of the DAX index at the time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Looking at the above, it is clear that heading into October of 2008, around 55% of VW shares were already **unavailable** in the market for any realistic purposes.  As a result, when Porsche increased its stake by an additional 44%, it meant that the true available float went down from 45% of outstanding shares to around just 1% of outstanding shares.  ***Suddenly the seemingly “low” short interest of 12.8% turned in to a massive supply and demand imbalance.***  Millions of shares needed to be bought immediately even though there were simply no shares available to be sold.

[https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/)  
Third paragraph is the money shot, other two for context.

&amp;#x200B;

I found another article somewhere that gave the same 12.8% figure (i forgot what it was and honestly cbf searching again for reference).  
And what's the percentage of GME currently? (time of writing is Monday 8:43pm in South Australia) - 138.08% of float, or 71.2M (I believe it is actually closer to 79M from another comment I read on another post.)  


  
Discussion time:  


Am I retarded and reading this wrong? I dunno. But I hadn't seen anyone talking about the VW short % of float so I did some smol digging.  
Personally I think when this thing hits, if it is an instant spike, $420.69 as hilarious as it fucking would be to sell the shorts their shares back to them, is simply scratching the surface of this. Technically, it should be going nuclear, looking at short interest and comparing to the VW squeeze.  


Food for thought - would be interested to hear your opinions on this.  
Also, I took Wednesday and Thursday off of work so I can stay up and watch this rocket go interstellar with you retards.

Seriously GME can easily pass 420.69. I don’t believe it will reach more than 1000 but you guys should definitely raise your sell price. I believe most people here set their sell limit to 420.69 because of the DD but once it hits this price it will drop again because all sell orders kick in. Seriously I believe we can push this easily to 694.20 or even a bit more than that. Don’t get too comfortable with 1000 %. That’s huge I know but you will hate yourself if you cash out too early. Raise your sell price. We can grow way beyond 420.69.

TLDR - Don’t sell at 420.69. It will grow more than that. Be patient.

45,kzsz8j,"GME: You Wouldn’t Download a PS5, Would You?",21,"Of course I fucking would, but as of 6:18AM EST I’m seeing that Twitter shills are trying to compare Blockbuster, to GameStop. Here’s how this is flawed:

Blockbuster, for those who are too young to have ever rented games from them, was a retail chain that specialized in MEDIA rentals. Keep that in mind. Media could be a game, or a movie, movies being the primary driver with games being the secondary source. You young kids, imagine a time when your internet was considered fast at ~356kb/s because you lived in NYC and had access to DSL (not the kind of DSL your girl showed me). Your friends were stuck on Dial Up, and you would use message boards and AOL Instant Messenger, pissing your parents off with the monthly bills for data usage.

Blockbuster was needed for those who only had a bit of allowance to spend on a game, but didn’t know wtf games were out there except for game reviews. Who trusted reviews to preorder Cyberpunked 2077? I certainly did, but for the same price as a digital download, I got the OST on CD (bangs in the car’s CD player), a box I can display as part of the collection, and a sick Samurai necklace I use as garlic to vampires who don’t understand my style.

It goes beyond this. Blockbuster failed because the CORE BUSINESS (movie rentals) was eventually gone when people could simply download 99% of the store (including emulators for games they rented and owned physical copies of, scratched to hell).

There was no need for them. But do you want, or need a PS5? When your wife comes over knowing you have a badass gaming setup and two controllers, would I make her return a cute plushie she got me locally when she didn’t even mean to buy it, but thought of me? How about the kids who have rich parents who tug them in and walk out with a bunch of niche but official memorabilia?

Now here comes someone who’s got kids and can’t afford any of this shit. They wistfully walk around the store, and spot the used case. $130 for a 3DS used? Better than the jack shit my kids have... you got any used games for this?

Here comes Richie Rich, just wants a new game and has no time for his old 3DS. Poor dad gets a bargain, Richie Rich doesn’t give a shit as long as he gets a discount on the newest, and boom. You’ve got GameStop being that arbiter of gaming merch.

Don’t even get me started on the kid buying up Pokémon cards for a rare pull to sell on eBay. Point is, Blockbuster didn’t adapt to changing times and didn’t have products that could rotate to eCommerce (since they skipped on RedBox, now Netflix). Blockbuster didn’t adapt because they had nothing to adapt with. Their product was a relic of the past. But since you can’t download a PS5, or download an original game cartridge or merchandise for your girlfriend to see you wear, don’t compare the two.

Blockbuster at most, had candy for non downloadable items. Oh, and marked up popcorn buckets.

I know you guys don’t like SPACs but this is something else entirely. The new SPCX ETF manages pre-merger SPACs and they always sell pre-merger ( or even if there is a significant bump in stock price) 

Up 11.78% since IPO in December and currently in a dip. 

Pros. 

1. Literally can’t go tits up. With the ETF being made up of spacs, the whole thing has a floor. 

2. The floor moves! Every time the my sell a spac and inject that money into their current holdings or a different spac, the floor moves higher. 

3. Get SPACs cheaper, SPACs are almost always trading a a premium to NAV when they IPO. SPCX will buy them at NAV. 

4. Exponential growth due to recycling money into news SPACs at NAV 

Cons. 

1. SPAC interest fades away and growth is slowed down 

2. You’ll have less money to yolo on BB and GME FDs.

3. Low volume. This ETF currently has really low volume and options spreads are horrible. I would recommend investing some time if you got into any options.

The volume issue should be fixed if we continue to see growth. (The ETF is only 1 month old)

⛽️ for the 🔥, WSBs favorite hedge fund shorts $BBBY

Remember, this is just all a hypothetical investment event. 

TL;DR - 
So the 💎🙌🏼 play = let $GME short squeeze to the 🌙, with the gains of that PURCHASE $BBBY shares and have another short squeeze to 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the 🌙 🌙🌙🌙 AGAIN, then buy LEAPS for $TXT and $VW cause there’s going to be so many rich AF people I know there’s going to be an uptick in private airplane orders and Lambos.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzw3sc/after_gme_short_squeeze_the_next_short_squeeze/,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52
98,kzw3wr,🚂End of the Line for GME🚂,25,"[https://www.tradingview.com/x/uyDiAaMY/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uyDiAaMY/)

Y'all might have f\*cked up. WSB pumped up the GME stock and inflated the Volume the 10-20x. It is called a pump and dump scheme for a reason. To maintain this pump, there needs to be more volume to prevent a liquidity dry up. This is impossible, so people do the second part, they dump. Some of y'all forgot to dump and that is starting to be a problem because volume is falling back to regular levels and the momentum is flatter than the Earth. Y'all really should sell guys, wtf are y'all doing? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Don't turn your GME gain porn into GME loss porn. Sell, put hedge or short+call hedge.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzw3wr/end_of_the_line_for_gme/,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52
99,kzw5gc,A stonk to create global peace,13,"With the US market closed today, DAX became the only place to trade GME, and it's occurred to me that it's amazing how this stock has brought such global unity. We all realised we're just a bunch of fuckwits wanting to pump a shit stonk to high heaven and get rich for once in our pleb lives. Watching our europoorean brothers hold the line today actually makes me feel quite proud, their willingness to sacrifice their portfolios at this chance of greatness was nothing to be underestimated, as they crusade along us against malvin and the institutes.

I cannot emphasise how retarded this idea actually seemed, that a bunch of retards on an online wendy's discussion forum could actually influence the market, and yet it feels as though there has truly been an impact, the amount of share buying induced by wsb cannot be insignificant at this point.

It's easy to believe that institutes would surely be ready for this, that they must have some risk management protocol, but with every long being added on, requests for more share lending and rising hard to borrow fees, all are pointing to signs of cracking under the surface. 

And so, as every stock market opens around the world, a new army of starry eyed retards come in to buy with the hope of making it big. The tears of a thousand portfolios will be shed, in one way or another, but the spirit of yolo will never die, as we realise we're all just a bunch of plebs, seeking to escape our mundane lives. Reading german wsb has made me realise that they too are fuckwits, and thus gives me hope on the level of retardation we can all achieve.

The spirit of autism is inside us all, in the end, however this saga may finish you can't say we didn't give it our retarded best.

Godspeed Autists
