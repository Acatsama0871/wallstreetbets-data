4,kzocqo,gjozzp2,"no one can predict what will happen on any stock on any day. if u like GME just buy shares and hold. if ur buying GME for the ""short squeeze"" that may or may not even happen, ur gonna paper hand. if u fundamentally believe in cohen and the growth of gme in 2021 just buy it."
5,kzocqo,gjozz6h,Buying shares on margin is bearish?
6,kzocqo,gjozxs1,"Nobody really knows, this is unprecedented. Buy shares, hold shares. Anyone talking about a price target is full of shit. Just watch the show"
7,kzocqo,gjozxdy,GME going to the moon! Lots of shorts are going to have to start covering. Daddy Cohen going to make it rain nuts 🥜🚀🌕
8,kzocqo,gjozwog,"If we know what will happen, we would’ve been billionaires. Best answer is it could go either ways. Gme to the moon tho🚀🚀🚀"
9,kzocqo,gjozsy0,Nobody knows shit about fuck
10,kzocqo,gjozsrh,"i thought the same thing as well, however since the cohen tweet i have had nothing but episodes of raging boners fantasizing over the print of next week."
11,kzocqo,gjozsev, 🚀🚀🚀🚀
12,kzocqo,gjozqkh,I'll let you know on Friday night what happened
13,gjq5jer,gk5q44m,wut? How dis works
14,kzotqk,gk4se3q,"Just do ITM debit spread of like 30-35 for the next 1 week, your breakeven will be around $33 and if GME closes above $35 next week you gain up to 50% of ur initial. repeat this until this retarded obssesion with GME stops"
15,gjsgzwi,gjsho2t,"well, I use robinhood. Easier and cleaner user-interface. So I don't have a clue of what you are talking about."
16,gjq2vwt,gjsgzwi,"Full spectrum tard, here. The only reason I haven't bought options yet is because I can't actually figure out how to on my broker (fidelity) .. I click Options and then get like 56009340 choices, when I click one of those, I get another bunch of choices at which point I nope the fuck back out."
17,kzotqk,gjs6kdz,"My issue with the April calls is when mine became deep itm last week, they didn't trade enough to really follow the share price and volume was low making them kind of a steal for the autist that bought em from me."

21,kzotqk,gjquaya,Gettin June 60c on Tuesday lets get this bread! (Some shares too so chill)
22,gjqm6xq,gjqml5a,"Haha fucking retard, thanks for the heads up though as I was itching to do it

Maybe Ill do it with BB instead"
23,gjp6zk7,gjqm6xq,"Sell covered calls like I did. 

I made 5k last week off them 

**and** 

the person who bought them from me made 85k 😱😱🤯🤯🙃"
24,gjp39zr,gjqe1h0,That shit cracked me up
25,gjp2jjq,gjq9y2k,This is the way
26,kzotqk,gjq5jer,You don't have to be a market maker to make money selling weekly options
27,kzotqk,gjq3qdx,Been doing this since the pandemic hit...don't tell these retards how to actually make consistent money.
28,gjq1ydv,gjq2vwt,"My fellow autist, from what I have have gather here is that you certainly can lose all your money in a couple of Option Trades (and I've only been here 9 days) so, me personally, I'll stay off options because ""there"" is no ""normal"". But, give it a try and if you lose money, then you mongoloid belong on this subreddt."
29,gjq0tkr,gjq1ydv,"Still learning about options haven’t actually bought any, I know what the current prices are for GME options but know you can also get them for $0.01-0.09 for other stocks. Just don’t have enough experience to know where the “normal” is if there is such a thing."
30,gjpu87c,gjq0tkr,I think high. I will look at it closely to see if I swallow my words.
31,gjp8qbo,gjpu87c,That high or low?
32,gjpqioi,gjprlqp,Can't believe it's a tits up bot
33,gjppngf,gjpqioi,literally going tits up
34,kzotqk,gjppngf,So if you got many shares sell the fuck out of OTM Calls. Collect kickass premium on FOMO buyers. Use premium to buy more GME shares. Cannot go tits up
35,gjpjxpc,gjpmt9l,Idk dude. Call your broker
36,gjp39zr,gjpm288,Consistency is primary
37,gjpjr97,gjpjxpc,Odd. My call options go from mar 19 to jun 18
38,gjpjbc5,gjpjr97,"I see 4/16 calls at both TDA and Robinhood, just double checked.

Would be odd for standard option contracts to not be offered one month but available the others?"
39,gjpj724,gjpjnji,"Ty... I knew IV crush on my options was a thing, just didnt know the ranges"
40,gjpezxr,gjpjbc5,Where are you seeing April calls? Td and webull go from March to June as options
41,gjpil0c,gjpj724,"We're all retarded here, but IV is kind of subjective. First you might want to compare it to the volatility of the market, and also the historic volatility of the option. A good rule of thumb is if the price jumped recently, the IV is probably high. Fun fact IV is overstated 85% of the time and the higher the IV the more overstated it tends to be according to tasty works, which is why it makes sense to sell FDs when IV is at it's peak. I would say in this market a low IV is up to 60% roughly."
42,gjp5ed7,gjpil0c,"What constitutes low vs high IV, in your opinion? Ballpark numbers...

I ask bc I'm tarded"
43,kzotqk,gjpezxr,"Nice little insight!!  I bought 3x 4/16 40C’s last week with profits from my other calls, for a similar reason.

Pretty likely to pass $40, excited to bolster my shares with more tendies"
44,gjp36qv,gjp8qbo,"As a newly baptized retard, I was amazed when I was reading that people were buying BB options for next week at 12c for jan 22 at .62cents."
45,kzotqk,gjp6zk7,"So basically sell a call

Buy an April call 

- profit???? 

An retarded and want to make premiums off my shares someone tell me what to do"
46,gjp3emd,gjp6cgk,He thinks we don’t brain think gudd.
47,kzotqk,gjp63m8,What are those purple and yellow crayon lines on the chart?
48,kzotqk,gjp5ed7,"Weeklies are mostly fine only if you understand that you have an allotted window, and if you hold onto them until expiry, you're opening yourself up to major damage. I do biweeklies and look to sell on an upswing and then open a new one on the next down tick at the next week's expiry. I always sell at least 3 days before expiry, but I'm always looking for an exit. In a high IV environment you want to avoid exposure to IV contraction, so shorter term options will give you better flexibility to open at those lower IV. For new people, what you're suggesting is very good though.  


For more clarification, as a seller, I look to sell in high IV environments, and I'll sell about 45 days out for maximum P/L. Though weeklies will have a higher W%, the P/L matters more to me because I'm never overexposed. (except on GME)  Now if we believe that to be the best set up possible, then what we should extrapolate is that for buyers, where that parabolic function is beneficial to sellers, it will be an inverted parabolic function for buyers. So we want to look at low IV environments (obviously) and date ranges both closer and further out from that 45 DTE mark.  


The reason W% is higher but P/L is lower for sellers doing weeklies (still net positive I believe), is because usually when they're wrong, they're wrong bigly. And for once I believe that they'll be wrong bigly, the set up looks too good for my calls not to print this week, though I will be either rolling them out or selling them before friday."
49,kzotqk,gjp538y,"Shares and April 16Cs checking in 😎

Thanks for spreading the /weekly/ knowledge to everyone"
50,kzotqk,gjp3um6,How come this DD doesn't have shiny metals. Good DD.
51,gjp36qv,gjp3emd,What do you mean by mentality
52,kzotqk,gjp3cxs,I love this! This is how we take control of the market away from market makers. 80% shares 20% otm 3 months expiration calls
53,gjp2z4k,gjp39zr,that dude saw the buy button and just kept fuckin' goin'
54,kzotqk,gjp36qv,Exactly same thing happening on BB. We gotta change the mentality of this sub.

56,gjp2jjq,gjp2z4k,go a few threads down for a retard who did that and then bet against himself
57,kzotqk,gjp2jjq,They can’t stop me if I buy options for **every** week
58,kzotqk,gjp2gy0,Both. Both is good.

86,gjphy8e,gjqydhs,I tried to buy 100 shares and my stupid fucking bank stopped me and I had to apply for approval to trade on international markets. Got approval on saturday. Fuck.
87,gjqwwwr,gjqy1y7,"No. They are the same exact stock and it will go up the same way. Again: we europoors are buying gamestop the Entire time at Frankfurt exchange. If it wouldnt go up the same way, then why would we buy it? Its called arbitrage. Google it. There are price differnces between Different exchanges yes, but it will always end up at the same price, because of MMs and algorithms trading in seconds to Profit off of these differences. If they would be 2 completely different stocks, almost every other exchange worldwide would be completely useless because the volume in the US is like 100x higher. There would literally be no Reason to buy any US stock for europoors if the price wouldnt be influenced by the US. How do you Think it would work that way? Like GME trading at a different price in a different country? Well awesome, i would just buy the stock At Frankfurt and sell it At NYSE immediately for a higher price. No. It doesnt work that way."
88,gjq4ajj,gjqx7xg,My life sucks too I did the exact same thing. Wish I threw it all down on GME but hey there is an upside for CLF in coming months with steel demand high
89,gjp6hp1,gjqwwwr,Wait are you saying if I was able to buy gamestop shares in the german market that they will also go up the same way as in the US? Are they not two completely separate shares?

108,gjqg2uh,gjqifpn,"Exactly. At the minimum. 

The funny thing is, that this is the conservative case! It is possible, an almost conceivable that there were shorters from 60 who took profits at 6 or 4 or 3 and since then have been replaced by more bankruptcy shorts.

This is unfortunately impossible to tell right now.

But the most conservative estimate, the most in favour of the shorters, is that there are between 25 and 30 million shorts who are still positive, given the current market value. And even this case means there are give or take 50 million shorts already under water.

Any of them trying to cover their position will snowball into more having to cover."

123,gjpm3su,gjqg2uh,"Ah, I didn't think about it like that. Thanks for the info! So if about half the shorts are betting on bankruptcy, that's still 70% of the float, which is way higher than any other short-squeeze still, i believe.

164,gjphiil,gjq4xjz,"I mean but it is somewhat indicative of sentiment. The actual prices are not directly related since its basically just the same item being traded in different contexts, but since the sentiment in europe is probably just a smaller version (imo) of ours due to the lower volume we should expect even more here. However, it is prudent to keep in mind that shorts are unlikely to have pressured downwards today and that perhaps a lot of the buying power in Europe is buying because precisely they are ahead of the price-in on Tuesday what ever that ends up being. But yeah, they are not at all connected formally the same way the same bag of chips could cost different things in different parts of the country/world."

265,gjpluoz,gjs0a1t,"Re: operating costs

They are closing underperforming stores quickly (11% in last year) at minimal cost due to short average lease terms of only 2 years. 40% of leases are up in the next year. The revenue transfer from closed stores to remaining nearby stores is about 40%, so closures are improving margins. Sherman has made huge strides in better working capital management, carrying less inventory, etc. He cut SG&amp;A by 1/3 in the last year. Also, RC is a self-described fanatic about costs.

Re: debt

They are in a net cash position. They only have about $360 million in debt outstanding ($73MM bond this March, two $25MM French term loans later in 2021, the $25MM on the revolver, and $216MM bond due in 2023), versus $475MM in cash. Bond market prices all their bonds above par, so is not worried about BK at all. They generate free cash flow, and will have no problem paying down this debt. The rest of the “debt” you see on stat sites like Yahoo or SA is lease obligations. Since the leases are short term and it’s cash flow positive, these aren’t really like debt... the leases will be paid as operating costs.

Position: 8500 shares"

My wicked stepmother thinks my lemonade stand will fail and she wants to profit from my loss. She gets a loan from the prince for lemons at $5/lemon and sells them to me thinking I would have to sell them back to her at a loss when I fail. I did not fail. My lemonade sells so well that the lemon prices go up to $35/lemon. The prince being rich and shrewd, has a store of lemons he is now selling for more than before. Since prices of lemons are high during this short window of high demand, the prince tells everyone who got lemon loans they need to return his lemons so he can sell them on the market so he can take his huge profit. Wicked stepmother must now return the original lemons to the prince or end up with their head on a pike. Well there are no lemons to be found at $35/ and so she goes to the prince to tell him she will pay him the market rate for lemons. He says the market rate is $1000/lemon, pay it or be executed for failing to pay debts. Meanwhile I’m squeezing lemons enjoying the fact that she’s either dead or destitute from the great lemon squeeze of 2021."

302,kzphxt,gjqo5id,Great work. But it seems you forgot to apply a discount rate. You projected revenues to 2023 and then predicted a valuation of $75 per share in 2024 immediately when the 2023 earnings are released. You must back this number by 3 time periods (years) using at least 14%. Similar logic is how I got to my $60/share valuation for myself

Being certain that any one specific thing will happen in any specific way is a mistake, because nobody knows what’s going to happen or how it’s going to happen. There are ideas obviously but they’re only thesis’s until it actually happens. 

Keep in mind that a year ago, people with a lot more experience in the market than anyone here bet hundreds of millions of dollars that GME would go bankrupt. Which is obviously a good thing for us now but it should serve as a reminder that it’s, at least possibly, a bad idea to get too specific about predicting the market.

308,gjqhved,gjqmb6p,"That's pretty speculative IMO, and I don't know for sure that it's realistic. GME might benefit from the esports boom but I don't suppose it'll be because they host in-person events - lots of more focused startups are already capitalizing on this. It's true that GME already has the locations though, so who's to say really. Might add some surprise upside in the future (1-2+ years) but I wouldn't bet on it"
309,gjqgikg,gjqlsp6,"The projections are pretty straight forward, so if we're really talking intrinsic value, even a DCF might paint a better picture. I think FOMO'll pump it, and if the ""short squeeze"" WSB's been hyping pans out because of this, it really could soar.

Edit: like buy 30% initially Then 20% more every downtick which might be higher that you bought in but you will be glad to have some shares if it moons but you will be glad you didn’t buy 100% at once if it drops lower. If it gets 10% down for the day, I would buy larger portions but if it’s down big tomorrow, that means bears have power on a day where we have the uptick rule which means it’ll probably drop even lower in the days to follow."

326,gjq9r5w,gjqfisa,"I agree - the comparables used here seem wildly out of place. For one thing, many of these companies don't have the same intense competition as GME, and second, since most of them are relatively young/unprofitable companies, their revenues are obviously low while their market valuations may be high due to growth projection. OP's projections are spot-on (aligned with S&amp;P analysts) but I'm not sure if it translates to the lofty evaluation proposed.

If there was in fact an increase in short positions then they may have kicked the metaphorical can down the road slightly hoping to shake the paper hands loose. Buy shares and not on margin. GME🚀🖐💎
330,gjqdluj,gjqe29c,"There is a chance, but if that happens, your order most likely won’t get filled anyway. The price when the market opens won’t be what it is right now. So if you have an order in now to buy 4K in shares at its current price it may work out a few different ways:

The price actually does open about the same as it is now, and your order is fine. Probably won’t happen, the price is more likely around 40 right now than what it’s showing. 

The price opens higher, and your order doesn’t go through

The price opens lower, and you overpay for the shares. 

This isn’t financial advice, but I’d say it’s generally a good idea to watch the market at open before you buy shares. If it does moon, it isn’t gonna go from 36-1000 in a minute. You’ll have time."

To be honest I've been looking for barriers to this growth but their financials really are in line with these ecommerce companies you quoted... If anyone has any pushback please lmk

342,gjq91kq,gjq9r5w,"To this I add the problem that in the video games industry, the ongoing trend has been for independent publishers and big name developers to either sell their games through digital distribution systems like Steam or their own proprietary distribution systems like Nintendo shop or PlayStation online, Xbox Live store, etc. For now all of these projections seem cool and all, but qualitatively speaking, I don't see why Nintendo Sony and Microsoft would allow GameStop in the long run to take a cut out of their own digital distribution-based profits. So GameStop will be left with used game sales for majority of profits. This is why they keep referring to GameStop as a blockbuster. In other words, wouldn't you rather invest in Netflix (the major distributer and producer of media) rather than on blockbuster (trying to reduce brick and mortar, and move online)? Similar situation here for GameStop vs Nintendo, Xbox, PlayStation, Steam. Also GameStop has to compete with Walmart, Bestbuy and other retailers including Amazon! The other day I bought a Mario game off Amazon because it was cheaper than on GameStop."
343,gjpmmu6,gjq9mge,Reddit gives out a lot of free gold these days for people not hand out to entice other people to buy gold. Not all of it is paid gold
344,kzphxt,gjq91kq,"Why is this a revenue-based analysis? We all know profit is what counts. I would rather to an analysis of the company's ability to create and maintain profit margins over the long term. At the end of the day, investors need to know that either they can get dividends from leftover profits, or capital gains from profit reinvestment into the company for future growth. Revenue multiple valuations have historically crumbled after frothy market collapses."
345,kzphxt,gjq8pxd,"Hey Thanks for this, imma have to unpack what you did here since I'm trying to learn pricing fundamentals and this post will help me a lot."
346,gjpryev,gjq8fif,"Use limit, buy at a price you're comfortable with. They can still short on up ticks.  Since there is no way to actually know when it will happen we just need to be patient and continue like business as usual. If you match the bid you should get filled.  But hey,  I'm just another retard on the internet.  You do you."
347,gjq36ag,gjq7z60,This is correct.  They can still short on up ticks. Each short is essentially them digging the grave a little deeper.
348,gjp6yde,gjq7mvj,Can you update with another post come Q1? I have a feeling there will be more growth in ecommerce between then and now. And we could also see a higher valuation from the comparables you listed. Also 🥜🥜🥜.
349,gjp72ns,gjq6eak,You are too retarded for this place.
350,gjp7bmp,gjq62ez,"I made 100k+ on shares alone by buying in early, YMMV"
351,gjpryev,gjq60bn,buy in frankfurt
352,kzphxt,gjq5x37,"Fuck yes, value play is massive and I tell that to every mouth breather on here who spams the daily with questions like:

Is it too late to get into GME?
Is my $39 cost avg too high?
Will my wife's bf ever look at my gains???

If you're willing to 💎🙌 this until RC has turned this ship around, then you can't lose. The squeeze should be fun too.

353,gjpf7ba,gjq5kp8,I had to use NewEgg because I didn’t want to drive 3hrs to the nearest Microcenter. I’ve got a GameStop 5min away though!
354,kzphxt,gjq5ak3,So do I buy on tuesday market open or should I expect there to be a dip during the day and buy then?
355,gjpnd2o,gjq4rmz,They're planning on closing down and consolidating their physical stores IIRC
356,gjp6yde,gjq3buq,"Thanks for the valuation analysis OP. I made a post about the MOASS-side PT on this as well, and I made sure to emphasize to our GME brothers that the more we wait, then the higher the potential squeeze price due to the organic growth that will happen even before a squeeze in itself, i. e. a positive change in price by way of the market catching up to fair value. The sheer undervaluation of GME as it stands right now is quite remarkable, even more so now that RC is at the helm; and WSB got a front-row VIP pass to the best seats in the show by way of early-adopter discount prices."
357,gjpryev,gjq36ag,Buy during a dip tomorrow.

404,gjpb08s,gjpccr3,also please charge your phone i'm worried about you
405,gjpb08s,gjpc7xn,so good indicator for demand &amp; peoples valuation of the price per share in Europe. But doesn't mean that the market in the US opens at 15%+ unless the sentiment is the exact same in the US.
406,kzppqo,gjpc279,"Hey Siri, how do I buy shares in a foreign market in the middle of the night on a 5 minutes notice?"
407,kzppqo,gjpbtca,If GME hits $100 on Tuesday I will get a peanut emoji tattooed on my ass.

412,gjp8c3w,gjpawkp,I don't understand how Euromarket can change if US is closed is it a different pool or shares or something?
413,gjpadfy,gjpajgk,I really hope it stays around the 35-40 mark until Tuesday market open
414,gjpa65i,gjpadfy,You’re gonna have to sack up and load up at a high price if you want in on this wild ride

427,gjp89sa,gjp8ipl,You think it’ll go up past 30s in premarket?
428,gjp7ire,gjp8gv5,"Usually it takes off in the morning here. So right now - as you can see. Your Market opens afaik at 15:30pm (our time).

430,gjp7pzx,gjp8c3w,Back to 14 Alain. just relax. Europe will not Show the direction of the Journey today. Not enough volume.
431,gjp7igs,gjp8buo,The fuck you talking about. Would give me very good reason to short the hell out of everything that dropped on Friday then.
432,gjp85vg,gjp89sa,"Not too high, but if it goes to like $43-$50 people tend to take their $5.00 profits and run...

The goal is 🚀🚀🚀🚀!!!"
433,gjp7m4m,gjp8756,Sounds autistic either way
434,gjp7m98,gjp85vg,Why do you say it’ll be too high ?
435,gjp7igs,gjp7z9m,"And here we have a person who has no clue what they’re talking about.

1) Last NYSE trading day, GME dropped 11% to $35 or 28 Euros. This is showing GME up 13% to 33.5 Euros or $40. So this is not just a reflection of the last trading day.
2) US markets are closed on Monday, so this stock move in no way is taking its cue from US markets and can actually be an indicator of what would happen to GME on the NYSE if the markets were open."
436,gjp7m98,gjp7sre,Yeah the volumes which are traded in eu are Kind of a joke... squeeze van only Happen when US is trading.
437,kzppqo,gjp7rgb,I'm so addicted I'm watching euro markets. BLESS
438,gjp7mxy,gjp7qux,Just to say that price going up on Frankfurt exchange is not indicative it will happen the same in NYSE. ( based on my frequent observation on GME price in both these exchanges . I live in Europe )
439,gjp7ire,gjp7q3l,You are fine brother. what's 50 dollar a share when it will go in to the hundreds or even above a thousand? Bottom line is the potential reward is much greater than the potential loss. So buy it and lets push it to the 🌕🌕🌕
440,kzppqo,gjp7pzx,And back to only 8% sadly
441,gjp7igs,gjp7nw4,It was open as Long as NYSE on Friday. So it closed with the Same loss which we had to take in the US.
442,gjp7igs,gjp7mxy,Can you explain this?
443,kzppqo,gjp7m98,"Just a reminder the squeeze won't happen until US markets are open, Melvin Capital is the enemy, most of this run are people buying in on the GME hype, the ugly part is the value will be high for us to buy more stocks on Tuesday!!

Do not sell!! Buy more and hold!! This is still the early stages!!

My read.  Sideways action with continued short manuvers but others buying shares for covered calls premarket (unless institutions join in for the squeeze, at this point, it is a decent possibility).  Massive volume Tuesday morning as all the weekly call gainers flip their shares to be absolutely gobbled up by the short owners and those late to the party.  Price will drive up and fluctuate.  It will then go sideways till about 1pm.  Then it will spike.  It isn't going to come down.  Wednesday, massive spike.  Thursday, massive green Shrek dildos.  Friday, sell off.  Price prediction:  69.42 EOW."

529,gjpaw1q,gjq0xua,"There is no ""official"" price for a stock. The price you see on most ticker charts is just the most recent price bought/sold. So hypothetically you could have a stock being traded on two exchanges for two different prices, but realistically someone with access to both will eventually try to take advantage of this and the prices converge. But there's nothing inherently wrong with the prices being different for small amounts of time."

consider BABA - a chinese stock. the US stock exchange is reactive because BABA is inherently chinese and thus there is a much higher volume in asia trading that. mind you, BABA is listed everywhere, in the US and many european exchanges. but they all try to mirror BABA’s performance in china. GME is no exception. there’s no volume in europe and it’s not a good indicator of GME’s future pricing on tuesday. it’s the european stock exchnage that tries to mimic GME on NYSE. no more stupid comments plz!"

666,kzqphp,gjpdbkh,"Lmao 1 week old sperg 450 shares of $GME, you're in the right place brother.

Calls are a type of option that you can buy (or sell) that gives you a contract, or more specifically that contract gives you the option to buy 100 shares at a given price. A put contract gives you the right to sell 100 shares at a price.

Options have 3 big factors: strike price, expiration date, and premium.

The **premium** is how much someone is charging (per share) for a contract, generally the higher the premium the more likely you are to make money but not always.

The **expiration date** is exactly what it sounds like, at the end of that day your contract expires, either **in the money** which means the price moved either above or below the strike price depending on the type of option (call or put) or if not then it expires **worthless**.

The **strike price** is the future price of the stock that will determine if the option is worthless or not when it expires, a higher strike for a call will be cheaper because the price has to rise more to reach it.

To sum it up: 

for buying **calls** if the price moves above strike price before expiry = **tendies** 

for buying **puts** if the price drops below strike = **tendies**

If you still don't understand options then it means you belong here with us"

Where as 1/13 it was 110 million

That will lift lots of pressure off the brokers --- since less volume --&gt; we may enter sideways? or not excess demand can cause Lot of people to sell their shares --&gt; may care bag holders?

For this thing to work, we want the SHort volume to GO UP high, infact it is GOING down rather up.

Gap up in my opinion, as I know that Q1 should be gang busters and if Sir Cohen drops another 13D, it’s gonna be a short covering bonanza.

Something I’ve thought about is that if Cohen indeed files one, shorts could theoretically use shares they own to simply slap the bid / ask spread while scalping calls to rotate, then exercise calls from paper hands with limit orders to replace shares they sold, and then they get to mitigate damage if they get out in time. Their focus undeniably will be weeklies, with theta burning off the weekly calls bought at the top.

That’s how I think they’re thinking hence Friday’s dip."

798,kzrih8,gjqismc,"As a poor retard who wants to buy 2k usd worth of GME shares and is very new to investing, I would like some advice if my understanding of the upcoming battle against the ghey bears is correct:

1. Is it correct that if we buy shares and we just hold for days(or weeks?) then the chances of us going to the moon is MUCH higher than the probability of us getting fucked in our asses?

2. There will be more than one squeeze that will be squoze in the upcoming weeks if we fuck the ghey bears? Or would this be just one gigantic squozening?

3. Do you guys think it is still possible that the price will dip to lower than 35usd? I understand timing the market is difficult, but I want to set buy orders to 35usd or lower.

4. What is the worst case scenario in this battle? It seems people are so bullish on GME and the impression that I get is that even if there's no squeezing happening, 35usd is still a good buy for a GME share.

5. IS INVESTING IN GOURD AGRICULTURAL FUTURES A GOOD DEA TO GET RICH AND RETIRE EARLY?

As always, I appreciate the help my autist brethren. You have my sword, my dong, along with my BB, PLTR and (upcoming)GME shares."

Like somebody else said, shareholders of VW were able to predict what the shareholders were goign to do since there were about 2 of them with major percentages. In the modern market, due to RH and other platforms, GME type of squeezes will be the only sort of squeezes we will see and this one will be used as a benchmark for the future. 

We're making history, I just have no idea where we will end up."

1048,gjpjq7n,gjpovtz,"This is what I'm worried about tbf, that the short % is a lot lower so the squeeze is potentially going to be much smaller than VW. I think that the big dogs know this so if the share price doubles they'll sell everything as that's still millions of profit for them, causing the price to drop lower than my Grandad's balls. 

This means all us autists are fcked as we've been 💎🤲 praying for it to hit $420.69. But what do I know? I'm severely retarded"
1049,gjpnrqe,gjpo0bo,"Oh I do too. But the OP was specifically talking about a short squeeze scenario. I was just throwing out another example of a violent rise that could have a different makeup of shareholders than VW. 

I’m holding 2,810 shares of GME @ $7.04. Ryan Cohen has me excited to see where the company goes, that said if this has a short squeeze and does something crazy like go to $200-300. I would be dumb not to sell and wait for the price to level back off to actually invest in the company."
1050,gjpnbsr,gjpnrqe,"I believe GME has a future, I just think people are unrealistic about timeframe and current value. Constantly comparing squeezes isn’t helping anyone.

1051,kzrxvu,gjpncib,"We keep using VW as an example, but when I look at their chart I see the price immediately drop right back down after the short squeeze in 2008."
1052,gjpn5eb,gjpnbsr,It’s the only one that immediately comes to mind that went up so high in 1 trading session. Overstock had a big run up too but it took months. Personally I think it’ll be more like that for Gme.

1054,gjpitda,gjpmtz5,"This.

1062,gjpirtx,gjpjwqb,"Don't expect anything, short positions don't have a set date to expire, will depend mostly on how high the price goes, this can last for some weeks. But it could be the opportunity of a decade."
1063,kzrxvu,gjpjq7n,"There's actually a lot of other factors to consider here:

1) short vs float (in the case of VW it was about 12% vs 1%). So the short % was 1200%. The short % for GME is at the absolute highest of estimates 200-400%, and that's assuming a rather large amount of diamond retail hands. This effectively allows us to eliminate the paper hands vs perfect porsche diamond hands difference.

2) VW stock before the spike part of the squeeze was at about 300 Euro, so the final % change for the spike was about 300%.

3) Trading volume. Days to cover short is an important statistic.

Anyways, the point is that short squeezes are all different. There's really no comparing them when considering all the factors such as company valuation, retail stock/shorts sellers/buyers, shorters' patience, etc. So don't be guessing prices based on a mostly incomparable set of data."

1066,gjpi8co,gjpjnjn,Crazy spike would be a disaster anyway. We need to give Robinhood time to come back up after its inevitable crash.
1067,gjpignd,gjpjkjk,"As someone else wrote yesterday in his post: the available float doesn't count the retail investors like us.
He even Made a calculation with how many shares everyone from this sub needs to buy to get the same ratio. He wrote that everyone would need to buy und hold 8 shares. If you consider that some people bought 100's and 100's of shares it might actually be realistic to reach the same ratio, even if not everyone bought 8 shares.

Edit: The post from yesterday was from u/RubinoffButtChug69"
1068,gjpignd,gjpj8sf,"I can't remember the exact figures off the top of my head but you're correct in saying the short percentage vs. available float for VW was higher than the current GME one.

However if we only include shares available to the free market for GME, then it's not as big a disparity as you think. This means removing any shares owned by Ryan Cohen or anyone else in GME who can't sell theirs and any institutions who require GME shares for their portfolio or ETF. Finally factor in Michael burry's holdings and WSB's amount and we're left with a figure somewhere in the 10-20 million range of available shares."
1069,gjpignd,gjpj4hz,"Ahhh, see, I am a retarded and don't know these things. I saw a big number and a small number and got excited, you know how it is  
lol"
1070,kzrxvu,gjpitda,"There is one key big difference. VW only had 2 significant shareholders and could predict how the other would act. Where as GME has hundreds if not thousands of shareholders who we cannot predict. For example, if someone who has bought in at $17 per share and they see it rocket to $170, they have already increased their money by 10x. Will they care about getting to $420.69?

Despite this i'm still extremely bullish on the prospect of GME reaching extraordinary heights like $400, but it really does depend on the diamomd hand 💎🙌 ability of the sub.

We need to spread the message about its potential and how the shorts only can pay the cheapest price we collectively give them!"

1074,gjpignd,gjpiizp,Would the $400-500 range peak seem realistic to you then?
1075,kzrxvu,gjpignd,"You have to compare Short Percentage with available float. Do some more research, then you will see that VWs Short Percentage vs. available float was a multiple higher than GME's currently is."

1120,gjq2vm0,gjq6894,"Calls are subject to timing (when exercised) and don't actually lock up shares. Wherever that call is assigned could still have a naked position and so those shares aren't being 💎✋. To help the squeeze that call would need to be exercised with perfect timing to convert it into shares to force the buying....aka you need to turn it into shares for squeeze to actually happen. 

Squeeze happens when there are no shares available for the 🌈🐻."

1218,kzsz8j,gjpqg8d,"Back before Netflix was doing streaming, in 2000, Blockbuster actually did it first. They partnered with Enron, of all companies, to provide a set-top-box that streamed video content directly to the customer's TV over the internet. It had some of the latest movies but eventually failed when Enron pulled the plug a year after the deal as they weren't confident Blockbuster could provide enough content.

Blockbuster also had an opportunity to buy Netflix for $50m in 2000 but turned the offer down.

I'd argue that it wasn't strictly a change in consumer behaviour that ultimately killed Blockbuster - it was mostly because it was badly run and failed to keep up with that consumer behaviour that led to their demise."

There’s still so much potential for GME. They’re the biggest game in town for a MASSIVE industry. My local community center started a fucking e-sports league. People PAY TO PLAY A GAME THEY’VE ALREADY PAID FOR AGAINST OTHER RETARDED RETARDS. They just need someone/thing to organize it. Strap me the fuck in.

1242,gjse90h,gjzzk97,It occurred to me later that having a large supply of borrowable stock makes it easier for the shorts to cover their position should the shares they already borrowed get recalled. Instead of having to buy shares at a huge loss they continue borrowing at a smaller loss.
1243,gjqbw5h,gju63bv,"You can create two accounts, one with lending one without, and move the shares with a few mouse clicks. Another way to prevent them from lending is to intentionally dip a few dollars into margin (they don't lend from accounts that have margin balance)."

Ultimately buy gold and silver too to hedge against inflation"
1271,gjsmn74,gjspsen,? That is what margin requirements are for. If they want to lower the risk they can increase the requirement. my guess is they did the math on this and found stealing from the lender to be more profitable.

1279,gjskevm,gjsmse7,basically just that i think the interest offered is peanuts relative to the volatility of a possible squeeze.
1280,gjq1obe,gjsmn74,But they take all the risk. If the person they lend to defaults they still have to recover the shares for you and pay the interest and pursue the lender in court.  You just sit back and collect.
1281,gjsm1qs,gjsmcig,"True, though I was kinda asking in a general sense. Might be an interesting idea in the case of heavily shorted stocks that are considered value plays long-term."
1282,gjsdvef,gjsm1qs,"i believe the rate is dynamic relative to demand, so i imagine after the squozening happens and the shorts cover, there will no longer be demand and therefore little to no interest."

i can see why folks would want to opt into a lending program.  for me it's just weighing the interest vs. the small probability i might contribute to a squeeze.  for me, with GME in Jan2021, i'm willing to forego that 1.3k for that small squeeze chance increase."

1300,gjqsiur,gjsholm,"personally, i think this rocket is fueled up enough now.  we're already at unprecedented levels.  being too greedy can get us burned.  but you do you.

🥜"
1301,gjsbozr,gjshn1h,"a lot of commentary has been saying the squeeze was why it shot up (cramer, other boomer sites). the sources on short interest in terms of how up to date they are, and how much theyre estimated?  and the available shares went way up friday.  similarly, if it DID squeeze, shorting (and causing interest to go up) doesnt seem like the stupidest move.  if you shorted VW at the peak you'd come out rich."
1302,gjq0fxb,gjshkdj,"Your broker doesn't give a fuck; they don't have any exposure one way or another. If they can make money lending your shares to someone else, they will try to get your permission (in return for passing some of the profits along). To do otherwise would be leaving money on the table for no reason."

1305,kzt49e,gjsg32c,Are my shares eligible for being lent to shorts if they are through TD Ameritrade? I have looked for 10+ minutes now (*a literal eternity* ) and I cannot find the answer as to how to opt-in to a shares lending program... so either they do it all the time and don't allow you to opt out or they don't do it at all?
1306,gjqy6cp,gjsfv0i,lol
1307,gjqynbr,gjsfqc2,"good question. i'm not entirely sure how FDIC and/or SIPC protection differs in this situation, but schwab does say:

""*Loss of SIPC protection.* Because borrowed securities may not be covered under the programs of  the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), loans are secured by collateral provided by Schwab.""

basically the way i understand it is that the cash value is protected by schwab unless they go bankrupt."
1308,gjqduy5,gjsf4gz,Just because you have margin available does not mean you used it to buy your gme shares.
1309,gjqztpx,gjsf0ad,"sounds like you might be fomo-ing and rushing into this.  just be careful.

i would say call your broker, but you're using RH.  maybe consider using a different broker?"

1313,gjr1oag,gjse90h,"i don't know anything, but it seems to me like the deep pockets of the shorts could outlast the wsb euphoria.  people are already looking at the next big play - BB is being touted as the next GME while GME is still in full swing.  personally, i think the shorts are deep enough and there is a thing as being too greedy - that's a formula for getting wrecked in bubbles and high volatility.  personally, i'm ready to see the shorts have to cover.  also, didn't the shorts last like 600 days with blue apron before they were forced to cover for other reasons?  anyways, we're also in a sort of unprecedented situation right now with gme, so who knows that can happen.  i wouldn't be surprised if the stock tanked to $9 or mooned to $420 next week.  seems like anything is possible and i worry about the paper hands when things are this volatile. i just know i'm ready to ride Mr. Cohen's wacky ride, squeeze or no squeeze."
1314,gjqhq9x,gjse0je,Yes it is the same. Jesus why do you think you can buy with unsettled deposits in the first place
1315,kzt49e,gjsdvef,"Would this be worth transferring stocks to lenders that offer this after the Squozening happens? Don't want to have them locked up in limbo when the price moons, although RH will probably just have an outage for a week anyway."
1316,gjr23td,gjscyem,"all i know is that i don't want to share my GME shares

🥜"
1317,gjr35h2,gjscm7n,"yea, i have about 15 positions.  but i suspect GME is the one they're especially interested in right now as it's certainly the spiciest.  however, joining their program gives them access to me entire portfolio."
1318,gjr3fgy,gjscfk2,"if it were any other stock any other month, i would definitely consider it.  but things are too exciting right now with GME.  even if not loaning my shares has a ""one in a million"" effect on increasing the probability of a short squeeze, as RC tweeted ""you're saying there's a chance.""  it's okay, i won't miss the 1.3k interest, and besides buying/selling 1 minute too soon or too late could have an even greater effect on my returns. it's all just 🥜"
1319,gjpw62g,gjsc2ap,[deleted]
1320,gjrlmbo,gjsbozr,Why would you think the squeeze happened last week when the short interest has increased?
1321,gjr3o47,gjsbhqk,for sure.  i'm pretty pleased with schwab as my broker.
1322,gjr83ey,gjsb6og,more or less
1323,gjrbsas,gjsb20y,"i hold about 15 different stocks with schwab and the other day i sorted them by their ratings.  almost all my % gains inverse their rating system, lol.  but i suppose when the market has lost its mind, it makes sense that some things don't make sense."
1324,gjrcxqd,gjsamk0,i dont think it's necessarily a bad thing at all.  it's just not part of my strategy with this particular security at this particular time.
1325,gjrildz,gjsa70z,i think the only instance this can happen is if schwab or gme go bankrupt.
1326,gjrgtpl,gjs9rub,there's a second screenshot that shows it. 12% btw
1327,gjrgzuh,gjs9msc,"could be.  but i'm here for the value.  a possible squeeze is just a cherry on top and it makes things fun.  but if share price drops to say $9, i still wouldn't be worried.  i would feel a bit sad that i didn't sell the top and buy back in on the dip, but no way i can time that with all the volatility and whatnot so i'll just hold.  i think eventually, if no squeeze happens, at some point it'll still settle at a fair value and i'll still be happy."

1647,gjpxtg8,gjq016f,"for the longest time it has been around the 50 million mark, which is why we always mentioned that shares shorted was ~130%. if morningstar indeed has 27million, that’s even better, more float is locked up. anyway it dosn’t matter, trust the process. gl to us"
1648,kzupt3,gjpztj7,Institutions only hold around 20-30%. The entire thesis was that short interest is at 72-73 (100+ %) of the float? Stop freaking people out with your retardation. The stock is up 15% in premarket in europe already.
1649,gjpyc4h,gjpzarm,"these intitutional shares aren't latest data + it's a speculation that they won't sell, so can't know for sure. One of the DD's I read a while back (from a guy that seemed smarter than me) said around 20M available to trade shares.

No way of knowing the bear hands"
1650,gjpyv0w,gjpz4ig,"Bro if the second is the case, we are going to explode tomorrow 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
1651,gjpy1hz,gjpyv0w,"I don't know a lot of these things myself, could be multiple reasons from what I gather:

&gt;The first, and usually most obvious, reason to explain why an institutional investor holds more than 100% of a company's shares stems from delays in updating publicly-available data. The figures released in an institution's report correspond to an institutional holding's date. These dates generally differ somewhat among all of the institutions that hold a company's stock, resulting in differences that could impact the reported percentage for total institutional holdings being displayed.

src:  [How Can Institutional Holdings Be More Than 100%? (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp)

&gt;Institutional ownership can eventually exceed 100 percent of float, which means that, in addition to all the available shares, institutions have also bought up all the borrowed shares from short sellers who are betting that the stock will decline

src: [The Disadvantages of High Institutional Ownership Stocks (pocketsense.com)](https://pocketsense.com/disadvantages-high-institutional-ownership-stocks-4748.html)

I guess in GME's case it's probably the second reason."
1652,gjpxyc4,gjpyggf,cmon guys... i wanna be an astronaut too
1653,gjpwdnw,gjpyc4h,"ok so as seen in another comment,
i now think the WSB free float is around 10 mil. ( = 69 mil. - 27% board shares - 58% institutional shares).

is that correct?
how can i now find out, how many of these are still in bear hands? (open for sell at an exchange?)"
1654,gjpxc8f,gjpy1hz,"so total shares = 69 mil.
shares by board (27%) = 19 mil.
shares by institutions acc. (58%) = 40 mil.
""free float"" = 69-19-40 = 10mil.

and how are there 122% of shares held by institutions? :(

1660,kzupt3,gjpx2jr,"bruh what the fuck are you on, it was always 50mil"
1661,gjpwdnw,gjpwt67,"so the board owns around 27% of shares.

how can i found out how many shares are available for purchase as of non, so i can tell how fked short sellers are?

(less shares to buy meaning higher prices of shares for short sellers)"
1662,gjpvz73,gjpwlid,"so how  do i even know how many shares are available to buy at any given time?

i thought we need to have small amounts of buyable shares, so the price to cover shorts would go up.

i thought this amount of buyable shares were roughly the freefloating shares (shares not held by institutions like BlackRock, Vanguard...)

As the German page states the total sum does not represent 100%. Meaning the free float of 73% contains part of the share holders beneath. Those share holders make up round about 80%, without retail traders. So nothing new... Move on and buy shares.

TL:DR 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"

This sentiment on the European side should be indicative though something similar on our side, but to my knowledge the volumes we have here should be a lot bigger. Generally, there is no ""official"" price for a stock. The price you see on most ticker charts is just the most recent price bought/sold. So hypothetically you could have a stock being traded on two exchanges for two different prices, but realistically sentiment is usually not that different in the modern digital age globally and people with access to both would eventually try to take advantage of a price difference and the prices converge. But there's nothing inherently wrong with the prices being different for small amounts of time.

1850,kzvgvp,gjq0ybr,"I'm sure it'll go up then come back down and hover around $32-$37 for a few days. Would be a good time to buy more. Like other posters have said on the board, set limit buy orders, don't pay market price."

1856,gjpzk1o,gjq0c2o,Same. 1000% is my exit strategy.
1857,gjpzp3r,gjq059z,Yes
1858,gjpzp3r,gjq04lt,"The writing on the wall says that the institutional interests have woken up to what's about to happen (hence the margins and disabled shorts) so I think the rocket is going soon.

FOMO's a hell of a fucker and if it does moon tomorrow and you didn't buy a ticket, will you be alright with that?

I'd say buy more, but just make sure you're happy with the potential short term risk of buying in at 40-45 if it dips down to 35 again. I 100% believe it'll moon soon (my options pray it will) and there's a huge support level at 35-36, but ask yourself 'Can I hold through 10-20% losses if the squeeze doesn't happen yet'. If the answer is no, don't do it."

There will be another short attack as Melvin will not walk quietly into the night (shorts will be fighting for their survival). 

Be patient, buy the dips and if you fuck a 🌈🐻 please use a condom (I hear gay bears have herpes).

Everyone should have unrealized gains come this time tomorrow.  Short squeeze will last multiple days and there will be posts documenting the remaining short interest.

Anyway I’ve got an order for 14 shares when the market opens and opened a Robinhood account and bought 4 more there so as to have some access to my tendies? On the moon? I think I’m doing this right? I’m on mobil so someone add rockets for me.
2058,gjs64xk,gjs6j7n,"Ah, i must've misunderstood the ruling. Just 💎✋, easiest job in the world. Literally just sit there and jerk off to the color green"

2060,gjs4znt,gjs64xk,"Nah that's incorrect. They can short but only above close price on friday (or open price tuesday, that i'm not too clear on, but they defo can and will create a price ceiling to prevent big upticks)"
2061,kzvk45,gjs62u8,All in GME did it for the patch
2062,gjqshgw,gjs5mez,Please! Europoor here and don't want to wait 6 months to get a patch lol

2067,gjqi3w0,gjs4yf9,each person's number should be their stake in the company. And for the captain the coveted 💎🙌 symbol
2068,gjq9r6k,gjs4nrq,I'm aiming for 1k with only selling for less if it drops to 30 because I'll still be up 100% if that happens 🚀🚀
2069,gjs0jd2,gjs4819,"I'd expect a price ceiling just because the shorts are fighting tooth and nail to keep it from popping too much. A whiff of positive news in the short interim will snowball this further. Or, RC's latest tweet could potentially mean more share buying... dunno."
2070,kzvk45,gjs3ywx,Can I still buy or nah lol
2071,gjs2wpb,gjs3svi,If it goes to 500 tomorrow do you sell or hold it for longer?
2072,kzvk45,gjs3dfv,I just convinced my friend to set up a market order for open tomorrow. He’s going to buy $1000 in GME shares. I’m doing my part. Let’s fucking go 🚀

2092,gjqeddq,gjqfk08,Just some more food for thought... You’ve struck a good point. We don’t know what will actually happen over the coming 12 months with Biden. The uncertainty itself could cause a lot of issues with investments. The market doesn’t always favor uncertainty. But uncertainty can be feast or famine! So we shall see how things pan out

2098,kzvw6e,gjqdus5,Accurate depiction of GME last Friday followed by GME this week.
2099,gjqbvv8,gjqdqhy,"The market doesn’t normally favor when one party controls most of the government. Usually bipartisanship control allows the market to flourish. But for all of our sake, I hope this is the time things are different. A change in our strategy against covid could possibly allow us to see the market climb even higher"
2100,gjqdbhn,gjqdjxf,Somehow I’ve mastered the art of getting through without being detected or killed. And always turn the game around on it’s ass.
2101,kzvw6e,gjqde9b,Goddamn I miss me some Battlefield 4.

2105,gjqcfek,gjqcj4c,The only server’s now that are active are siege of shangai and operation locker.
2106,gjqbvv8,gjqcgrk,"Lets hope it drops, I'm not counting on it though"
2107,gjq9rzl,gjqcfek,"Not really, at least not for conquest large. Just played last night and had to wait in queue to join a couple different lobbies with 64 players"

Only thing I'm worried about is possible slowing growth as SPAC hype dying down with direct listing getting easier.

2193,gjq5gkj,gjqbosk,I set a limit order at $36.5 which is slightly above the closing price Friday do you think these will get filled on open tomorrow? My thought process is that it will open at the same price as it closed and my order will be filled by people who sold after close over the weekend for less than my limit.

2255,kzw3sc,gjq7koo,"There is no after GME, after the squeeze i'll buy the hard dip and go for a long position"
2256,gjq4jcm,gjq71jo,"I tell you what, split the difference and go with BBY. Can’t go wrong"
2257,kzw3sc,gjq6kgo,Calls on r/fuckmelvin
2258,kzw3sc,gjq4ux3,"After BBBY, look to MAC for the trifecta"
2259,gjq48n5,gjq4los,Blackberry= $BB
2260,gjq48n5,gjq4jcm,BBBY is Bed Bath and Beyond. Blackberry is BB
2261,kzw3sc,gjq4ey9,Bought calls last friday 🚀🚀
2262,kzw3sc,gjq48n5,"Hold up, BBBY isn't Blackberry?"
2263,kzw3sc,gjq40wr,"Lookin at it, but aint leaving my main bitch GME for a side squeeze until she croaks."
2264,gjq36vw,gjq3wp6,"They have a new CEO. Former Target overhaul guy. Could actually work
🚀🚀🚀

Not jumping fully into BBBY until GME is over and Melvin looses their shirt.
Melvin is short BBBY too...LMAO"
2265,gjq3gvq,gjq3r8a,Nothing wrong with coming up with a plan. But did edit to say buy GME. You guys are right. Doesn’t work any other way.
2266,gjq388h,gjq3pn9,"All I'm seeing is GME and 🚀🚀🚀.

I'm a simple man."

2268,gjq3cft,gjq3gvq,Notice he said FOCUS
2269,gjq31lx,gjq3cft,Notice how I said AFTER GME.
2270,kzw3sc,gjq3c0r,Bought $30c 2/19 last week. LFG!
2271,kzw3sc,gjq388h,Sooo Buy GME shares
2272,kzw3sc,gjq36vw,Bbby doesn’t have papa cohen
2273,kzw3sc,gjq32nk,[deleted]
2274,kzw3sc,gjq31lx,Stop trying to find another squeeze. There’s a historic squeeze about to happen right in front of your eyes. Focus on that.
2275,kzw3wr,gjq9e9i,train emojis? what nonsense is this?
2276,kzw3wr,gjq7tnq,Hi Melvin!
2277,kzw3wr,gjq6uvb,It’s up today with less volume  dumbass
2278,kzw3wr,gjq6u25,"Self professed bear and you tried this shit with TSLA.

Fuck off."
2279,kzw3wr,gjq6oka,"I don't get it, everyone check this guys post history, he's been with the GME GANG for quite a bit, now all of a sudden he posts this garbage with a retarded graph?

# I swear to god Melvin is legitimately buying out WSB people FUCKING HOLD PEOPLE💎🙌

edit: HE DELETED THE POST, THIS SHIT IS SKETCHY BOIS"
2280,kzw3wr,gjq64dw,"Not a pump and dump ;). That implies two things:

1) No actual increase in value (very false, look at all the DD's)

2) Not primed for short squeeze (which it is so much. You can argue about patience of institutions, etc, but whether it happens or not, the pressure is there and it's very high)"
2281,kzw3wr,gjq5ptc,This guy also posted 187 days ago a chart that looks exactly like this saying Tesla was going to start tanking....
2282,kzw3wr,gjq4xwg,Buy have you seen RC’s Twitter???
2283,kzw3wr,gjq46vm,How’d the TSLA short position go for you?
2284,kzw3wr,gjq45ge,"Who’s dumping? I don’t see anyone dumping. 

Brokerages know, the first one to cover is the only one that survives. 

Writing is on the wall. Who’s going to blink first??

👋🏻💎👋🏻💎👋🏻💎👋🏻💎👋🏻💎👋🏻"
2285,kzw3wr,gjq41b7,Downvoted cuz Melvin.
2286,gjq30is,gjq3wbp,"And I am going to aay this once for all the gay fucking bears out there that are pretending to help. If you are we appreciate it it, but come back with some real fuckin DD. We have as many good Bull DD's as Bull memes. And the memes are all I need."
2287,kzw3wr,gjq3kr2,Ok Melvin
2288,kzw3wr,gjq3git,[removed]
2289,kzw3wr,gjq3fze,You have no idea what are you talking about. Or you're a troll...
2290,kzw3wr,gjq3f68,Nice try to make us lose our money. Now go away Melvin Capital. In GME we trust. Its up 18% at Frankfurt [https://m.onvista.de/aktien/GAMESTOP-CORP-Aktie-US36467W1099](https://m.onvista.de/aktien/GAMESTOP-CORP-Aktie-US36467W1099)
2291,kzw3wr,gjq3c9x,"If can’t simply see that this is going to be the biggest short squeeze within the next 10 days, then you’re just a retard like all of us were before some DD’s opened our eyes. Go read some boi. Look at the % of shorts, just that"
2292,kzw3wr,gjq363x,OP big mad they missed the +100% last week.
2293,kzw3wr,gjq33j3,Nobody likes you
2294,kzw3wr,gjq33cx,It's up 15% retard
