14,kzotqk,gk4se3q,"Just do ITM debit spread of like 30-35 for the next 1 week, your breakeven will be around $33 and if GME closes above $35 next week you gain up to 50% of ur initial. repeat this until this retarded obssesion with GME stops"
15,gjsgzwi,gjsho2t,"well, I use robinhood. Easier and cleaner user-interface. So I don't have a clue of what you are talking about."
16,gjq2vwt,gjsgzwi,"Full spectrum tard, here. The only reason I haven't bought options yet is because I can't actually figure out how to on my broker (fidelity) ..

17,kzotqk,gjs6kdz,"My issue with the April calls is when mine became deep itm last week, they didn't trade enough to really follow the share price and volume was low making them kind of a steal for the autist that bought em from me."

22,gjqm6xq,gjqml5a,"Haha fucking retard, thanks for the heads up though as I was itching to do it

Maybe Ill do it with BB instead"
23,gjp6zk7,gjqm6xq,"Sell covered calls like I did. 

I made 5k last week off them 

**and** 

the person who bought them from me made 85k üò±üò±ü§Øü§ØüôÉ"
24,gjp39zr,gjqe1h0,That shit cracked me up
25,gjp2jjq,gjq9y2k,This is the way
26,kzotqk,gjq5jer,You don't have to be a market maker to make money selling weekly options
27,kzotqk,gjq3qdx,Been doing this since the pandemic hit...don't tell these retards how to actually make consistent money.
28,gjq1ydv,gjq2vwt,"My fellow autist, from what I have have gather here is that you certainly can lose all your money in a couple of Option Trades (and I've only been here 9 days) so, me personally, I'll stay off options because ""there"" is no ""normal"". But, give it a try and if you lose money, then you mongoloid belong on this subreddt."
29,gjq0tkr,gjq1ydv,"Still learning about options haven‚Äôt actually bought any, I know what the current prices are for GME options but know you can also get them for $0.01-0.09 for other stocks. Just don‚Äôt have enough experience to know where the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is if there is such a thing."
30,gjpu87c,gjq0tkr,I think high. I will look at it closely to see if I swallow my words.
31,gjp8qbo,gjpu87c,That high or low?
32,gjpqioi,gjprlqp,Can't believe it's a tits up bot
33,gjppngf,gjpqioi,literally going tits up
34,kzotqk,gjppngf,So if you got many shares sell the fuck out of OTM Calls. Collect kickass premium on FOMO buyers. Use premium to buy more GME shares. Cannot go tits up
35,gjpjxpc,gjpmt9l,Idk dude. Call your broker
36,gjp39zr,gjpm288,Consistency is primary
37,gjpjr97,gjpjxpc,Odd. My call options go from mar 19 to jun 18
38,gjpjbc5,gjpjr97,"I see 4/16 calls at both TDA and Robinhood, just double checked.

Would be odd for standard option contracts to not be offered one month but available the others?"
39,gjpj724,gjpjnji,"Ty... I knew IV crush on my options was a thing, just didnt know the ranges"
40,gjpezxr,gjpjbc5,Where are you seeing April calls? Td and webull go from March to June as options
41,gjpil0c,gjpj724,"We're all retarded here, but IV is kind of subjective. First you might want to compare it to the volatility of the market, and also the historic volatility of the option. A good rule of thumb is if the price jumped recently, the IV is probably high. Fun fact IV is overstated 85% of the time and the higher the IV the more overstated it tends to be according to tasty works, which is why it makes sense to sell FDs when IV is at it's peak. I would say in this market a low IV is up to 60% roughly."
42,gjp5ed7,gjpil0c,"What constitutes low vs high IV, in your opinion? Ballpark numbers...

I ask bc I'm tarded"
43,kzotqk,gjpezxr,"Nice little insight!!  I bought 3x 4/16 40C‚Äôs last week with profits from my other calls, for a similar reason.

Pretty likely to pass $40, excited to bolster my shares with more tendies"
44,gjp36qv,gjp8qbo,"As a newly baptized retard, I was amazed when I was reading that people were buying BB options for next week at 12c for jan 22 at .62cents."
45,kzotqk,gjp6zk7,"So basically sell a call

Buy an April call 

- profit???? 

An retarded and want to make premiums off my shares someone tell me what to do"
46,gjp3emd,gjp6cgk,He thinks we don‚Äôt brain think gudd.
47,kzotqk,gjp63m8,What are those purple and yellow crayon lines on the chart?
48,kzotqk,gjp5ed7,"Weeklies are mostly fine only if you understand that you have an allotted window, and if you hold onto them until expiry, you're opening yourself up to major damage. I do biweeklies and look to sell on an upswing and then open a new one on the next down tick at the next week's expiry. I always sell at least 3 days before expiry, but I'm always looking for an exit. In a high IV environment you want to avoid exposure to IV contraction, so shorter term options will give you better flexibility to open at those lower IV. For new people, what you're suggesting is very good though.  


For more clarification, as a seller, I look to sell in high IV environments, and I'll sell about 45 days out for maximum P/L. Though weeklies will have a higher W%, the P/L matters more to me because I'm never overexposed. (except on GME)  Now if we believe that to be the best set up possible, then what we should extrapolate is that for buyers, where that parabolic function is beneficial to sellers, it will be an inverted parabolic function for buyers. So we want to look at low IV environments (obviously) and date ranges both closer and further out from that 45 DTE mark.  


The reason W% is higher but P/L is lower for sellers doing weeklies (still net positive I believe), is because usually when they're wrong, they're wrong bigly. And for once I believe that they'll be wrong bigly, the set up looks too good for my calls not to print this week, though I will be either rolling them out or selling them before friday."
49,kzotqk,gjp538y,"Shares and April 16Cs checking in üòé

50,kzotqk,gjp3um6,How come this DD doesn't have shiny metals. Good DD.
51,gjp36qv,gjp3emd,What do you mean by mentality
52,kzotqk,gjp3cxs,I love this! This is how we take control of the market away from market makers. 80% shares 20% otm 3 months expiration calls
53,gjp2z4k,gjp39zr,that dude saw the buy button and just kept fuckin' goin'
54,kzotqk,gjp36qv,Exactly same thing happening on BB. We gotta change the mentality of this sub.

56,gjp2jjq,gjp2z4k,go a few threads down for a retard who did that and then bet against himself

87,gjqwwwr,gjqy1y7,"No. They are the same exact stock and it will go up the same way. Again: we europoors are buying gamestop the Entire time at Frankfurt exchange. If it wouldnt go up the same way, then why would we buy it? Its called arbitrage. Google it. There are price differnces between Different exchanges yes, but it will always end up at the same price, because of MMs and algorithms trading in seconds to Profit off of these differences. If they would be 2 completely different stocks, almost every other exchange worldwide would be completely useless because the volume in the US is like 100x higher. There would literally be no Reason to buy any US stock for europoors if the price wouldnt be influenced by the US. How do you Think it would work that way? Like GME trading at a different price in a different country? Well awesome, i would just buy the stock At Frankfurt and sell it At NYSE immediately for a higher price. No. It doesnt work that way."
88,gjq4ajj,gjqx7xg,My life sucks too I did the exact same thing. Wish I threw it all down on GME but hey there is an upside for CLF in coming months with steel demand high

108,gjqg2uh,gjqifpn,"Exactly. At the minimum. 

The funny thing is, that this is the conservative case! It is possible, an almost conceivable that there were shorters from 60 who took profits at 6 or 4 or 3 and since then have been replaced by more bankruptcy shorts.

This is unfortunately impossible to tell right now.

But the most conservative estimate, the most in favour of the shorters, is that there are between 25 and 30 million shorts who are still positive, given the current market value. And even this case means there are give or take 50 million shorts already under water.

Any of them trying to cover their position will snowball into more having to cover."

123,gjpm3su,gjqg2uh,"Ah, I didn't think about it like that. Thanks for the info!

The actual prices are not directly related since its basically just the same item being traded in different contexts, but since the sentiment in europe is probably just a smaller version (imo) of ours due to the lower volume we should expect even more here. However, it is prudent to keep in mind that shorts are unlikely to have pressured downwards today and that perhaps a lot of the buying power in Europe is buying because precisely they are ahead of the price-in on Tuesday what ever that ends up being.

265,gjpluoz,gjs0a1t,"Re: operating costs

They are closing underperforming stores quickly (11% in last year) at minimal cost due to short average lease terms of only 2 years. 40% of leases are up in the next year. The revenue transfer from closed stores to remaining nearby stores is about 40%, so closures are improving margins. Sherman has made huge strides in better working capital management, carrying less inventory, etc. He cut SG&amp;A by 1/3 in the last year. Also, RC is a self-described fanatic about costs.

Re: debt

They are in a net cash position. They only have about $360 million in debt outstanding ($73MM bond this March, two $25MM French term loans later in 2021, the $25MM on the revolver, and $216MM bond due in 2023), versus $475MM in cash. Bond market prices all their bonds above par, so is not worried about BK at all. They generate free cash flow, and will have no problem paying down this debt. The rest of the ‚Äúdebt‚Äù you see on stat sites like Yahoo or SA is lease obligations. Since the leases are short term and it‚Äôs cash flow positive, these aren‚Äôt really like debt... the leases will be paid as operating costs.

Position: 8500 shares"

My wicked stepmother thinks my lemonade stand will fail and she wants to profit from my loss. She gets a loan from the prince for lemons at $5/lemon and sells them to me thinking I would have to sell them back to her at a loss when I fail. I did not fail. My lemonade sells so well that the lemon prices go up to $35/lemon. The prince being rich and shrewd, has a store of lemons he is now selling for more than before. Since prices of lemons are high during this short window of high demand, the prince tells everyone who got lemon loans they need to return his lemons so he can sell them on the market so he can take his huge profit. Wicked stepmother must now return the original lemons to the prince or end up with their head on a pike. Well there are no lemons to be found at $35/ and so she goes to the prince to tell him she will pay him the market rate for lemons. He says the market rate is $1000/lemon, pay it or be executed for failing to pay debts. Meanwhile I‚Äôm squeezing lemons enjoying the fact that she‚Äôs either dead or destitute from the great lemon squeeze of 2021."

There are ideas obviously but they‚Äôre only thesis‚Äôs until it actually happens. 

Keep in mind that a year ago, people with a lot more experience in the market than anyone here bet hundreds of millions of dollars that GME would go bankrupt.

For one thing, many of these companies don't have the same intense competition as GME, and second, since most of them are relatively young/unprofitable companies, their revenues are obviously low while their market valuations may be high due to growth projection.

330,gjqdluj,gjqe29c,"There is a chance, but if that happens, your order most likely won‚Äôt get filled anyway. The price when the market opens won‚Äôt be what it is right now. So if you have an order in now to buy 4K in shares at its current price it may work out a few different ways:

The price actually does open about the same as it is now, and your order is fine. Probably won‚Äôt happen, the price is more likely around 40 right now than what it‚Äôs showing. 

The price opens higher, and your order doesn‚Äôt go through

The price opens lower, and you overpay for the shares. 

This isn‚Äôt financial advice, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs generally a good idea to watch the market at open before you buy shares. If it does moon, it isn‚Äôt gonna go from 36-1000 in a minute. You‚Äôll have time."

339,gjpdqh6,gjqbn9c,"I don‚Äôt trust online retailers with expensive computer parts, past 4 years I‚Äôve bought exclusively at micro center because they stay competitive with price and I know that I can‚Äôt take back whatever I buy and get a replacement that day. If GameStop starts selling graphics cards and other parts I‚Äôll go there because it‚Äôs a lot closer and I know I can my pc up and running that day. If I buy from Newegg and the card doesn‚Äôt work I have to wait weeks for another one."
340,kzphxt,gjqblhi,"Sorry, new WSB user here. Love the analysis, but my issue is that GME can only reach these multiple valuations if people come to see the company as an online retailer - as it stands, they definitely consider it a B&amp;M business, hence the low valuations. My question becomes: how can GME really attain this 40% ecommerce growth? To be honest I've been looking for barriers to this growth but their financials really are in line with these ecommerce companies you quoted... If anyone has any pushback please lmk

Would it be too late to try to get in on GME at market open tomorrow? I see most of you are already holding positions"

342,gjq91kq,gjq9r5w,"To this I add the problem that in the video games industry, the ongoing trend has been for independent publishers and big name developers to either sell their games through digital distribution systems like Steam or their own proprietary distribution systems like Nintendo shop or PlayStation online, Xbox Live store, etc. For now all of these projections seem cool and all, but qualitatively speaking, I don't see why Nintendo Sony and Microsoft would allow GameStop in the long run to take a cut out of their own digital distribution-based profits. So GameStop will be left with used game sales for majority of profits. This is why they keep referring to GameStop as a blockbuster. In other words, wouldn't you rather invest in Netflix (the major distributer and producer of media) rather than on blockbuster (trying to reduce brick and mortar, and move online)? Similar situation here for GameStop vs Nintendo, Xbox, PlayStation, Steam. Also GameStop has to compete with Walmart, Bestbuy and other retailers including Amazon! The other day I bought a Mario game off Amazon because it was cheaper than on GameStop."
343,gjpmmu6,gjq9mge,Reddit gives out a lot of free gold these days for people not hand out to entice other people to buy gold. Not all of it is paid gold
344,kzphxt,gjq91kq,"Why is this a revenue-based analysis? We all know profit is what counts. I would rather to an analysis of the company's ability to create and maintain profit margins over the long term. At the end of the day, investors need to know that either they can get dividends from leftover profits, or capital gains from profit reinvestment into the company for future growth. Revenue multiple valuations have historically crumbled after frothy market collapses."
345,kzphxt,gjq8pxd,"Hey Thanks for this, imma have to unpack what you did here since I'm trying to learn pricing fundamentals and this post will help me a lot."
346,gjpryev,gjq8fif,"Use limit, buy at a price you're comfortable with. They can still short on up ticks.  Since there is no way to actually know when it will happen we just need to be patient and continue like business as usual. If you match the bid you should get filled.  But hey,  I'm just another retard on the internet.  You do you."
347,gjq36ag,gjq7z60,This is correct.  They can still short on up ticks. Each short is essentially them digging the grave a little deeper.
348,gjp6yde,gjq7mvj,Can you update with another post come Q1? I have a feeling there will be more growth in ecommerce between then and now. And we could also see a higher valuation from the comparables you listed. Also ü•úü•úü•ú.

355,gjpnd2o,gjq4rmz,They're planning on closing down and consolidating their physical stores IIRC
356,gjp6yde,gjq3buq,"Thanks for the valuation analysis OP. I made a post about the MOASS-side PT on this as well, and I made sure to emphasize to our GME brothers that the more we wait, then the higher the potential squeeze price due to the organic growth that will happen even before a squeeze in itself, i. e. a positive change in price by way of the market catching up to fair value. The sheer undervaluation of GME as it stands right now is quite remarkable, even more so now that RC is at the helm; and WSB got a front-row VIP pass to the best seats in the show by way of early-adopter discount prices."

1) Last NYSE trading day, GME dropped 11% to $35 or 28 Euros. This is showing GME up 13% to 33.5 Euros or $40. So this is not just a reflection of the last trading day.
2) US markets are closed on Monday, so this stock move in no way is taking its cue from US markets and can actually be an indicator of what would happen to GME on the NYSE if the markets were open."

439,gjp7ire,gjp7q3l,You are fine brother. what's 50 dollar a share when it will go in to the hundreds or even above a thousand? Bottom line is the potential reward is much greater than the potential loss. So buy it and lets push it to the üåïüåïüåï

My read.  Sideways action with continued short manuvers but others buying shares for covered calls premarket (unless institutions join in for the squeeze, at this point, it is a decent possibility).  Massive volume Tuesday morning as all the weekly call gainers flip their shares to be absolutely gobbled up by the short owners and those late to the party.  Price will drive up and fluctuate.  It will then go sideways till about 1pm.  Then it will spike.  It isn't going to come down.  Wednesday, massive spike.  Thursday, massive green Shrek dildos.  Friday, sell off.

666,kzqphp,gjpdbkh,"Lmao 1 week old sperg 450 shares of $GME, you're in the right place brother.

Calls are a type of option that you can buy (or sell) that gives you a contract, or more specifically that contract gives you the option to buy 100 shares at a given price. A put contract gives you the right to sell 100 shares at a price.

Options have 3 big factors: strike price, expiration date, and premium.

The **premium** is how much someone is charging (per share) for a contract, generally the higher the premium the more likely you are to make money but not always.

The **expiration date** is exactly what it sounds like, at the end of that day your contract expires, either **in the money** which means the price moved either above or below the strike price depending on the type of option (call or put) or if not then it expires **worthless**.

The **strike price** is the future price of the stock that will determine if the option is worthless or not when it expires, a higher strike for a call will be cheaper because the price has to rise more to reach it.

To sum it up: 

for buying **calls** if the price moves above strike price before expiry = **tendies** 

for buying **puts** if the price drops below strike = **tendies**

If you still don't understand options then it means you belong here with us"

That will lift lots of pressure off the brokers --- since less volume --&gt; we may enter sideways? or not excess demand can cause Lot of people to sell their shares --&gt; may care bag holders?

For this thing to work, we want the SHort volume to GO UP high, infact it is GOING down rather up.

Something I‚Äôve thought about is that if Cohen indeed files one, shorts could theoretically use shares they own to simply slap the bid / ask spread while scalping calls to rotate, then exercise calls from paper hands with limit orders to replace shares they sold, and then they get to mitigate damage if they get out in time. Their focus undeniably will be weeklies, with theta burning off the weekly calls bought at the top.

798,kzrih8,gjqismc,"As a poor retard who wants to buy 2k usd worth of GME shares and is very new to investing, I would like some advice if my understanding of the upcoming battle against the ghey bears is correct:

1. Is it correct that if we buy shares and we just hold for days(or weeks?) then the chances of us going to the moon is MUCH higher than the probability of us getting fucked in our asses?

2. There will be more than one squeeze that will be squoze in the upcoming weeks if we fuck the ghey bears? Or would this be just one gigantic squozening?

3. Do you guys think it is still possible that the price will dip to lower than 35usd? I understand timing the market is difficult, but I want to set buy orders to 35usd or lower.

4. What is the worst case scenario in this battle? It seems people are so bullish on GME and the impression that I get is that even if there's no squeezing happening, 35usd is still a good buy for a GME share.

5. IS INVESTING IN GOURD AGRICULTURAL FUTURES A GOOD DEA TO GET RICH AND RETIRE EARLY?

Like somebody else said, shareholders of VW were able to predict what the shareholders were goign to do since there were about 2 of them with major percentages. In the modern market, due to RH and other platforms, GME type of squeezes will be the only sort of squeezes we will see and this one will be used as a benchmark for the future.

This means all us autists are fcked as we've been üíéü§≤ praying for it to hit $420.69. But what do I know? I'm severely retarded"
1049,gjpnrqe,gjpo0bo,"Oh I do too. But the OP was specifically talking about a short squeeze scenario. I was just throwing out another example of a violent rise that could have a different makeup of shareholders than VW. 

I‚Äôm holding 2,810 shares of GME @ $7.04. Ryan Cohen has me excited to see where the company goes, that said if this has a short squeeze and does something crazy like go to $200-300. I would be dumb not to sell and wait for the price to level back off to actually invest in the company."

1062,gjpirtx,gjpjwqb,"Don't expect anything, short positions don't have a set date to expire, will depend mostly on how high the price goes, this can last for some weeks. But it could be the opportunity of a decade."
1063,kzrxvu,gjpjq7n,"There's actually a lot of other factors to consider here:

1) short vs float (in the case of VW it was about 12% vs 1%). So the short % was 1200%. The short % for GME is at the absolute highest of estimates 200-400%, and that's assuming a rather large amount of diamond retail hands. This effectively allows us to eliminate the paper hands vs perfect porsche diamond hands difference.

2) VW stock before the spike part of the squeeze was at about 300 Euro, so the final % change for the spike was about 300%.

3) Trading volume. Days to cover short is an important statistic.

Anyways, the point is that short squeezes are all different. There's really no comparing them when considering all the factors such as company valuation, retail stock/shorts sellers/buyers, shorters' patience, etc. So don't be guessing prices based on a mostly incomparable set of data."

1067,gjpignd,gjpjkjk,"As someone else wrote yesterday in his post: the available float doesn't count the retail investors like us.
He even Made a calculation with how many shares everyone from this sub needs to buy to get the same ratio. He wrote that everyone would need to buy und hold 8 shares. If you consider that some people bought 100's and 100's of shares it might actually be realistic to reach the same ratio, even if not everyone bought 8 shares.

Edit: The post from yesterday was from u/RubinoffButtChug69"
1068,gjpignd,gjpj8sf,"I can't remember the exact figures off the top of my head but you're correct in saying the short percentage vs. available float for VW was higher than the current GME one.

However if we only include shares available to the free market for GME, then it's not as big a disparity as you think. This means removing any shares owned by Ryan Cohen or anyone else in GME who can't sell theirs and any institutions who require GME shares for their portfolio or ETF. Finally factor in Michael burry's holdings and WSB's amount and we're left with a figure somewhere in the 10-20 million range of available shares."
1069,gjpignd,gjpj4hz,"Ahhh, see, I am a retarded and don't know these things. I saw a big number and a small number and got excited, you know how it is  
lol"
1070,kzrxvu,gjpitda,"There is one key big difference. VW only had 2 significant shareholders and could predict how the other would act. Where as GME has hundreds if not thousands of shareholders who we cannot predict. For example, if someone who has bought in at $17 per share and they see it rocket to $170, they have already increased their money by 10x. Will they care about getting to $420.69?

Despite this i'm still extremely bullish on the prospect of GME reaching extraordinary heights like $400, but it really does depend on the diamomd hand üíéüôå ability of the sub.

We need to spread the message about its potential and how the shorts only can pay the cheapest price we collectively give them!"
1071,gjpin05,gjpirtx,But if short positions expire tomorrow is that already effective at pre-market?
1072,gjpil3x,gjpin05,Could be any day soon... Nobody is sleeping until markets close.
1073,kzrxvu,gjpil3x,Is it supposed to be üåù tomorrow at pre-market already?
1074,gjpignd,gjpiizp,Would the $400-500 range peak seem realistic to you then?
1075,kzrxvu,gjpignd,"You have to compare Short Percentage with available float. Do some more research, then you will see that VWs Short Percentage vs. available float was a multiple higher than GME's currently is."

I lived in a small town and we still have the same internet speeds that we had over 20 years ago


It's not even like bumfuk nowhere and even satellite internet isn't reliable all the time plus they have data caps so good luck downloading games

Same thing with wireless carriers I switched my parents over to 4G simply because their internet is faster (the can actually stream TV unlike their dsl) however it's capped at 400 gigs a month. what is that one-game?

Not including any streaming tv updates etc etc."

1218,kzsz8j,gjpqg8d,"Back before Netflix was doing streaming, in 2000, Blockbuster actually did it first. They partnered with Enron, of all companies, to provide a set-top-box that streamed video content directly to the customer's TV over the internet. It had some of the latest movies but eventually failed when Enron pulled the plug a year after the deal as they weren't confident Blockbuster could provide enough content.

Blockbuster also had an opportunity to buy Netflix for $50m in 2000 but turned the offer down.

I'd argue that it wasn't strictly a change in consumer behaviour that ultimately killed Blockbuster - it was mostly because it was badly run and failed to keep up with that consumer behaviour that led to their demise."

i can see why folks would want to opt into a lending program.  for me it's just weighing the interest vs. the small probability i might contribute to a squeeze.  for me, with GME in Jan2021, i'm willing to forego that 1.3k for that small squeeze chance increase."

1302,gjq0fxb,gjshkdj,"Your broker doesn't give a fuck; they don't have any exposure one way or another.

I have looked for 10+ minutes now (*a literal eternity* ) and I cannot find the answer as to how to opt-in to a shares lending program... so either they do it all the time and don't allow you to opt out or they don't do it at all?

1307,gjqynbr,gjsfqc2,"good question. i'm not entirely sure how FDIC and/or SIPC protection differs in this situation, but schwab does say:

basically the way i understand it is that the cash value is protected by schwab unless they go bankrupt."

1318,gjr3fgy,gjscfk2,"if it were any other stock any other month, i would definitely consider it.  but things are too exciting right now with GME.  even if not loaning my shares has a ""one in a million"" effect on increasing the probability of a short squeeze, as RC tweeted ""you're saying there's a chance.""  it's okay, i won't miss the 1.3k interest, and besides buying/selling 1 minute too soon or too late could have an even greater effect on my returns. it's all just ü•ú"

1322,gjr83ey,gjsb6og,more or less
1323,gjrbsas,gjsb20y,"i hold about 15 different stocks with schwab and the other day i sorted them by their ratings.  almost all my % gains inverse their rating system, lol.  but i suppose when the market has lost its mind, it makes sense that some things don't make sense."
1324,gjrcxqd,gjsamk0,i dont think it's necessarily a bad thing at all.  it's just not part of my strategy with this particular security at this particular time.
1325,gjrildz,gjsa70z,i think the only instance this can happen is if schwab or gme go bankrupt.
1326,gjrgtpl,gjs9rub,there's a second screenshot that shows it. 12% btw
1327,gjrgzuh,gjs9msc,"could be.  but i'm here for the value.  a possible squeeze is just a cherry on top and it makes things fun.  but if share price drops to say $9, i still wouldn't be worried.  i would feel a bit sad that i didn't sell the top and buy back in on the dip, but no way i can time that with all the volatility and whatnot so i'll just hold.  i think eventually, if no squeeze happens, at some point it'll still settle at a fair value and i'll still be happy."

1645,gjpwc2h,gjq4dbl,You are retarded
1646,kzupt3,gjq201p,the easiest way to know is just to put a market order in for 70M shares and see how many fill
1647,gjpxtg8,gjq016f,"for the longest time it has been around the 50 million mark, which is why we always mentioned that shares shorted was ~130%. if morningstar indeed has 27million, that‚Äôs even better, more float is locked up. anyway it dosn‚Äôt matter, trust the process. gl to us"
1648,kzupt3,gjpztj7,Institutions only hold around 20-30%. The entire thesis was that short interest is at 72-73 (100+ %) of the float? Stop freaking people out with your retardation. The stock is up 15% in premarket in europe already.
1649,gjpyc4h,gjpzarm,"these intitutional shares aren't latest data + it's a speculation that they won't sell, so can't know for sure. One of the DD's I read a while back (from a guy that seemed smarter than me) said around 20M available to trade shares.

1650,gjpyv0w,gjpz4ig,"Bro if the second is the case, we are going to explode tomorrow üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"
1651,gjpy1hz,gjpyv0w,"I don't know a lot of these things myself, could be multiple reasons from what I gather:

&gt;The first, and usually most obvious, reason to explain why an institutional investor holds more than 100% of a company's shares stems from delays in updating publicly-available data. The figures released in an institution's report correspond to an institutional holding's date.¬†These dates generally differ somewhat among all of the institutions that hold a company's stock, resulting in differences that could impact the reported percentage for total institutional holdings being displayed.

src:  [How Can Institutional Holdings Be More Than 100%? (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp)

&gt;Institutional ownership can eventually exceed 100 percent of float, which means that, in addition to all the available shares, institutions have also bought up all the borrowed shares from short sellers who are betting that the stock will decline

src: [The Disadvantages of High Institutional Ownership Stocks (pocketsense.com)](https://pocketsense.com/disadvantages-high-institutional-ownership-stocks-4748.html)

I guess in GME's case it's probably the second reason."
1652,gjpxyc4,gjpyggf,cmon guys... i wanna be an astronaut too
1653,gjpwdnw,gjpyc4h,"ok so as seen in another comment,
i now think the WSB free float is around 10 mil. ( = 69 mil. - 27% board shares - 58% institutional shares).

is that correct?
how can i now find out, how many of these are still in bear hands? (open for sell at an exchange?)"
1654,gjpxc8f,gjpy1hz,"so total shares = 69 mil.
shares by board (27%) = 19 mil.
shares by institutions acc. (58%) = 40 mil.
""free float"" = 69-19-40 = 10mil.

and how are there 122% of shares held by institutions? :(
sorry for my autism"
1655,kzupt3,gjpxyc4,"Your dumb af,  another Melvin attack attempt:  fuck off .  Gme üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ.  Buying more at open üöÄüöÄüöÄ"
1656,gjpx2jr,gjpxtg8,It was 27 million
1657,gjpwt67,gjpxc8f,"You look at this page [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME) and determine which one of the institutional holders won't sell then you do

free float (as read on ft) - sum of all institutional shares that won't sell"
1658,gjpx2jr,gjpxbru,"bro i can hardly read ...
gotta get to the moon anyway
trust in GME"
1659,kzupt3,gjpx9cx,Can someone tell me why morningstar has it as 27 million? Do they calculate it differently?
1660,kzupt3,gjpx2jr,"bruh what the fuck are you on, it was always 50mil"
1661,gjpwdnw,gjpwt67,"so the board owns around 27% of shares.

how can i found out how many shares are available for purchase as of non, so i can tell how fked short sellers are?

(less shares to buy meaning higher prices of shares for short sellers)"
1662,gjpvz73,gjpwlid,"so how  do i even know how many shares are available to buy at any given time?

i thought we need to have small amounts of buyable shares, so the price to cover shorts would go up.

i thought this amount of buyable shares were roughly the freefloating shares (shares not held by institutions like BlackRock, Vanguard...)

&amp;#x200B;

pls halp"
1663,gjpw70a,gjpwhd5,Thats what I needed to hear. 2.5k to GME and another 2.5k to BBs just to warm up. Then PLTR
1664,gjpvdft,gjpwfh7,"total shares are around 70 mil (fixed). 

i swear there were only 9% free float on saturday, so 5-6 mil. shares were freefloat"
1665,kzupt3,gjpwdnw,"Shares available - board shares = free float

Because we figure that institutions won't sell easily, in our calculations we dei

Shares available - board shares - institutions shares = WSB free float 

This WSB free float is a lot less"
1666,gjpvrxo,gjpwc2h,"i swear to god free float % was 9% or in total 5 mil. shares on saturday.

this to me means, someone sold a lot of shares or am i completely retarded"
1667,gjpvtj7,gjpw70a,I am buying $700 GME $200 BB at market open. Get in üöÄüöÄüöÄ
1668,kzupt3,gjpvz73,"Dude, you need to read more carefully... but I am not expecting anything different from my fellow retards.

As the German page states the total sum does not represent 100%. Meaning the free float of 73% contains part of the share holders beneath. Those share holders make up round about 80%, without retail traders. So nothing new... Move on and buy shares.

TL:DR üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"

This sentiment on the European side should be indicative though something similar on our side, but to my knowledge the volumes we have here should be a lot bigger. Generally, there is no ""official"" price for a stock. The price you see on most ticker charts is just the most recent price bought/sold. So hypothetically you could have a stock being traded on two exchanges for two different prices, but realistically sentiment is usually not that different in the modern digital age globally and people with access to both would eventually try to take advantage of a price difference and the prices converge. But there's nothing inherently wrong with the prices being different for small amounts of time. Think of it as items being sold for different prices in different stores in different parts of the country/world."

Those institutions are going to need to start covering losses via buying shares and calls, instead of getting more premiums via shorting. It's to the point that they can't short on a down tick which is a minor method to manipulate the price down.

It's more pressure. They have to cover more shares than are actually available and the retards here aren't walking away for less than a 10 bagger lol"

FOMO's a hell of a fucker and if it does moon tomorrow and you didn't buy a ticket, will you be alright with that?

I'd say buy more, but just make sure you're happy with the potential short term risk of buying in at 40-45 if it dips down to 35 again. I 100% believe it'll moon soon (my options pray it will) and there's a huge support level at 35-36, but ask yourself 'Can I hold through 10-20% losses if the squeeze doesn't happen yet'.
