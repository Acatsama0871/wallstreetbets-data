53,l7l2tb,gl7cx0l,"Citadel Securities makes the components of trading platforms that allow you to buy, sell, set limits, and essentially all other variables that allow YOU to control risk. Take a look at the Citadel Securities website and see what they actually provide under their Equities and Options tab. It is eye-opening to say the least to see what they are in control of.
Robinhood disabling an integral part of the essential components that allow a buyer and a seller to be found and a transaction to be made, is where they messed up. Interfering with transactions that are coming from retail traders that use Robinhood specifically is what seems against a regulation or law of some kind.
You can’t take an essential component away from certain securities transaction flows that flow from a very specific group that Citadel has collected/is gathering real time data on and an opposing vested interest (short position). That creates an unweighted advantage in that transaction, which to me to me is almost as bad as an un-deliverable transaction."

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**
