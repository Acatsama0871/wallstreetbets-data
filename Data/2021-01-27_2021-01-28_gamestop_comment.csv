487,gkymjul,gkyny1m,"Thanks for this. So looking into it, my understanding is they borrowed shares or bonds at a price, sold them, now need to buy them back to return them, but they're hoping to buy them back at a lower rate so they profit. And as long as the price keeps increasing, they can't return those borrowed shares/bonds without a loss. Is that about right? And if so, what's stopping them from just taking the loss and getting rid of their shorts now before it gets even higher?"
