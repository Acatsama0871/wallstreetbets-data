239,gl157fl,gl16ond,Love you mate I’m not fucking selling!
240,l665ar,gl157fl,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to “tap” down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it’s only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I’ve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It’s a classic short move.

If you don’t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren’t calling in favors like this right now you’re living in fucking fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It’s only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price.

If you wake up and see $100 and your heart falls out your pussy and you get paper hands, game over. If you see $100 and instead remember how fucking jazzed you were when it first hit that and hold, you win baby.

If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There’s no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

Please share and upvote this for god sakes so people don’t think everyone else selling out and giving up!!!! Please someone who can post copy and post this I don’t want credit I just don’t want the little guy to lose!

FYI I work in healthcare and have 6 figures in student loan debt and I’m finally making enough $ from you retards that makes me think one day I might pay off. I’m doing my part!"

I looked for anything I could sell or any quick ways to raise the $ with little risk. I was going to start a gofundme but I did not want charity. I came to Reddit to see what other options other than surgery were (none really) and came to WSB to see what plays were being made here. Then after reading for a few house I understood what was really going on...

I saw an opportunity to save my friend and I went for it. Now my best friend is scheduled for surgery next week and is in a much better mood (I think because he can feel that Im in a better mood)"
