8,l4hidu,How GME shorts will actually cover(a simplified explanation from someone who is still learning),1,"Firstly, you gotta know that a lot of the float in GME is synthetic long. What is that?

Synthetic shares simplified: Assuming there are only 10 shares and M is the original owner of all the shares. When X short a share. X borrows it and sells it and someone else buys it. If Y is the buyer, Y is also now an owner of a share.

Because there were only 10 stock to begin with. And because now there are 11 shares in the hands of M and Y. Y's 1 share is a piece of the original share. And M has 1 synthetic share.

Now if you continue that, there is no real limit to how much shares can become synthetic. There could be only 10 shares in existence and synthetics could be 50 shares as it could be shorted again and again.

But there are some limiting factors for which this sort of scenarios don't happen.
1. Borrow rate and 2. Selling and buying of shares.

Once you borrow a share, you gotta pay the cost of borrowing. Now when you are borrowing again and again, the actual shares becomes harder and harder to borrow exponentially and interest rates also increase exponentially. Why?

Lets get back to the original scenario. Suppose after X shorted a share, he shorts one more. After first event there was actual borrow ratio of 1/11. After his second short, his borrow ratio is 2/12. Do it again, and you would 3/13. Can you see how the shares shorted linearly leading to crowding of borrowers and the interest increasing exponentially?

Now let's assume, X shorted all of M's shares and if Y bought all of it. So there’s 20 total share owners in the market.

Now, lets say the price of that stock is £420.69. If M, let's say decides to sell his 5 shares. The broker must provide M with his 5 shares to sell. The broker is on the hook. The broker cannot just buy them. So the broker tells X, ""Bro, you give me back the 5 shares I lent you as  you promised you would return them to me whenever I need them or pay M the money of his 5 shares, like right now.""

If X just decides to buy back those 5 shares from M(which is more likely), he is covering. X will pay the M the monetary value of those 5 shares at the market price and destroy those 5 synthetic shares. As a result, M is left with 5 synthetic shares, money worth of 5 shares and Y is still owner of the 10 shares. Whereas X is still short on 5 shares. So, total shares in the market is 15.

But X have had to pay a heavy price. Because he was forced to buy from M. M priced his shares as high as he could get away with.

Think about it. The case was M selling shares which should have added downward pressure to the stock. Instead it creates an upward momentum since the short is forced to perform open market operation. This is a very illiquid scenario with only 3 fixed participants.

In reality, if no one is interested in buying, M would have to reduce his share price. This would mean X's plan is successful. He would offer M a price of £100 to buy back those 5 shares. If M agrees, X profits from this whole ordeal and M loses profit.

Shorts in a way, artificially reduce price since them shorting creates excess supply. If X didn’t short the 10 shares in the first place, M would have been able to sell them to Y for higher prices since Y wants to buy it.

But in a real world scenario, this is unlikely, since there are lots of fancy uses of algorithm to keep the price stable and lots of volume. Market makers, buyers and sellers with differences in motives.

Borrowing cost of X's shorts however would decline. Since previously, he was 10 shares short out of 20 total shares or 50%. Now he is 5 shares short out of 15 or 33%.

I hope you understood somewhat how synthetic shares and their borrowing works?

Now, let's come back to the real world. In case of GME, as long as there’s newer and newer buyers, shorts could just create more synthetic shares and suppress the price. But newer buyers also add an upward momentum to the stock in that if there's more demand then supply, price would rise.

So this becomes a pretty complex scenario. Shorts paying heavy interest rate based on the latest stock price. They are still shorting and being able to suppress the stock price by increasing supply. But that supply is being eaten up by the insatiable demand of us(retail investors).
Add to that gamma hedging by market makers. Scalper bots trying to take opportunity of the slightest movement in price, this becomes a garbled scenario that's pretty hard to explain.

All I could say is this. Taking into consideration, the additional synthetic shares, I read from ShortSight[ShortSight](https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/)(a venture from S3 Partners to inform people about this sort of thing) that the real GME Short Interest of float is 60%(very outdated data, probably already changed a lot) but if you take the faulty calculations of float by some vendors, it is close to 200-300%(those are irrelevant).

But taking that synthetic shares into consideration, a 60% SI of flost is extremely explosive. Explosive to the point that it could not be easily described in words.

Think about this, if for one reason or another, lets say, due to a combination of constant gamma squeeze, Ryan Cohen’s tweeting, good news development of Gamestop etc shorts finally decide to cover. They have to perform an open market operation of unprecedented scale relative to a company's size.

*This is how it will unfold.* A short firm, decides, it’s not worth it any more to keep on bleeding interest payment.
They decide to cover. Meaning all the extra synthetic longs that has been created now has to be bought back, paying the synthetic longs their share price.

All of a sudden, out of 70M short shares there's 65M. Next week there’s 60M.

Other hedge fund sees slowly(5-10% in a week let's say) rising prices and declining short interest. They immediately understand that someone is covering. If they were to remain sitting, they would possibly get margin called at the last 20% of the game.

Why? Because paper hands will always sell out with the smallest of gains. But there are some people who would not(institutional investors, diamond hands etc). So even though short interest continues to decline the availability of shares that are actively traded actually keeps on getting more and more reduced.

So they would have to raise their prices to unsustainable levels to actually get to make diamond hands sell. This could get you margin called, which nobody wants. Because if they do, their funds would be finished for good.

Ultimately, this becomes a self fulfilling prophesy, fund managers dash to buy shares from the open market. Leading to boom boom boom booom booooom booooooom.

A good analogy of this scenario would be the rush hours at metros. If everyone decided for an orderly exit and entry, no one would have suffered, but since everyone is self interested, everyone suffers. And the longs rake in tendies.

This however is unlikely to happen if only one or two funds are behind this huge short interest. In that case, they may collude and let prices fall as much as they can, potentially even banking profits. In that case shorts would make an orderly exit and prices wouldn’t rise much, if it rises at all.

*That's it.*

If you haven’t understood shit, no problem. I don't either. This is my best guess of how things would turn out from recently reading all I can about GME and synthetics.

If I had to use an even simpler method to describe the whole situation, it is figuratively similar to the fractional reserve banking system. Banks can keep very little money on hand compared to deposits. And they in turn.increase supply of money int the economy, making money cheaper. Fractional banking and synthetic longs could be thought of as the same type of system.

If suddenly everyone decides to dash for their money in their bank, the bank would immediately default(if there's no central bank). 

Similarly, if for one reason or another, shorts try to cover their positions quickly, they are forced to buy the synthetics they have created at exorbitant price and this further fuels the machine.

Not to mention the various scalper bots, algos, hedge funds, retail traders that take every opportunity of this sort of situation and create further buying pressure and force shorts to cover at more and more worse price.

This situation could get further exacerbated if the shorts are margin called.

If the shorts have huge margin(like 10s to 100s of billions) and are able to maintain their margin they may be able to weather the storm and finally cover when this whole ordeal is actually over. Here, their margin is like central bank.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4hidu/how_gme_shorts_will_actually_covera_simplified/,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

12,l4hnrh,GME insider quiet period (ie insiders can’t sell right now)! 🚀🚀🚀,10,"TLDR: Citron said in his video that a squeeze can’t happen if insiders keep selling, but insiders (likely) CAN NOT sell company issued stock because of end of fiscal quarter lockup/blackout period, which usually extends until earnings are reported (weeks from now!)

Alright listen up. I did a quick search on WSB and didn’t see any hits actually talking about what is known as a “quiet period” or “blackout” for corporate stock trades in relation to insiders selling their company issues GME stock.

You NEED to know this to understand one of the big points that Citron made is complete BS in the short term (insiders creating liquidity for shorts).

I’m assuming that many WSBers have never received stock based compensation and may not know the general corporate governance rules around them that many (most/all?) companies impose on their insiders. Here’s a quick education in that and a summary of what it (might) mean for GME.

Obligatory disclaimer: I’m not a financial advisor and I am long GME.

First: what is stock based compensation?

This is exactly what it sounds like, when as part of your comp for being a good employee, you get some sort of stock with some sort of conditions attached. There are many different flavors of this that are important.

options - these give you the right to buy stock at some fixed price, known as a strike price, which may be significantly below than market value (good!). There are many different types of option (eg ISO, NQ), but at the end of the day most are a discount coupon for cheap below market stock values. These are common for preIPO companies. You’ll see these in the world of SPACs, for example, as warrants.

RSU: restricted stock units - these are literally shares, given almost like cash. More common for post IPO companies.

PRSU: performance RSUs - usually tied to some job performance goal, such as hitting a certain amount of revenue or other measurable goal.

Almost all stock based compensation comes with conditions, such as complying with whatever is in the associated company stock/equity plan. These are usually things like time vesting, which simply means that you can’t take stock and run but rather have to let it vest over a period of months/years.

From the wallst perspective, stock comp is reported as an expense, so you’ll see it in financial disclosures and investor presentations from time to time.

Second: how do companies ensure these incentives don’t hurt them or other shareholders?

This is critically important. Besides making sure there are clear policies on vesting and such, companies need to make sure that insiders do not use their company granted stock to hurt themselves or other shareholders, by performing trades during times when the employees may have critical information that the public does not. 

This is usually wrapped up in an insider trading policy.

Now, when WSB usually thinks about insider trading, you may think some hot head exec tipping off their golf buddy that the stock is about to crash (or pop) and they should act accordingly. Yes, that’s insider trading; however, there is a more mundane version which is insiders who might have a general idea if earnings are going to be good or bad and making trades of their own company stock to profit themselves.

To protect against that, companies will often place quiet periods / trading blackouts BEFORE THE END OF A QUARTER, often by weeks at a time, AND EXTEND THAT BLACKOUT THROUGH EARNINGS REPORT DAY.

READ: end of GME quarter is THIS MONTH, meaning it is incredibly likely that all GME issued stock owned by insiders is locked up under the corporate blackout.

This is almost certainly why you don’t see RC or anyone else from GME saying anything right now, due to quiet period.

In practical terms, GME would likely partner with a trading platform to administer stock grants, such as E*TRADE (which is common). The stock admin at GME would communicate blackout dates to E*TRADE (in this example), and During these dates, all of the sell functions in that stock plan account would be disabled.

READ: GME insiders see their stock plan values going through the roof right now, and CAN NOT SELL because of corporate blackout. This means the shorts can’t cover with insider liquidity like Citron said.

Since these blackouts usually extend thru earnings, and that is weeks away, those shares would be unavailable to bail out the shorts for paper handed insiders.

SUMMARY
Citron said short squeeze can’t happen when insiders are selling .... Insiders (very likely) can’t sell because of end of quarter blackout

This should be common knowledge for Citron and other shorts. Anyone else on here who has dealt with stock based comp, please do sanity check me here and I’m happy to edit and refine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4hnrh/gme_insider_quiet_period_ie_insiders_cant_sell/,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

21,l4i4yq,"GME, Recovery Time, and Regret 🚀🚀🚀",1,"It was late March of 2009 my wife and I (four kids under 4) were trying to get out from under our house payment. We were contemplating moving in with my parents to save money. My drop shipping business was going under, and things were extremely tight. I had to pick up a short term sales job just to help pay the bills. 

We had 10,000k sitting in our bank account waiting to be spent on necessities, medical bills, and insurance costs for a recent baby. I vividly remember sitting in front of my computer contemplating my yearly Roth investment and what to do...Max our Roths or pay the bills. At that time, Apple was floating at 100 dollars pre 4-1 split and pre 7-1 split.  Roughly 350,000 worth today. I decided to pay the bills and do what was best for my family at the time. Which was good, but not the best good.

Since 2009 I've made roughly 1.3 million in salary, had three more kids, and not one day goes by that I don't think ""what if"" . Don't get me wrong, I have an amazing wife, life, and seven beautiful kids, but I wonder every day where I could be if I had pulled the Roth trigger. 

We have so much time on our side to catch up from mistakes.

I know there are those who are new here wondering what this is all about. I know you are faced with tough finacial decisions, and all sorts of other stuff, but you having so much time on your side. So 5, 10, 15, 20, years from now do you want to have regrets for not jumping in.
